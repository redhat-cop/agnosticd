= Execution Environment Release Cycle

== Overview

The release cycle for execution environments is designed to go through several stages to ensure quality and stability. These stages include development, automated builds for Pull Requests, alpha release, release candidate (RC), and stable releases.

*UPDATE 2024-03*:  Rename `alpha` to `rc` (Release Candidate) for clarity.

== Release Phases

=== 1. Development

. *Branch Creation*: A feature or bug-fix branch is created based on the `development` branch.
. *Pull Request*: A Pull Request (PR) is submitted, triggering automated build processes.

=== 2. Automated PR Builds

. *Environment Build*: An ephemeral execution environment is automatically built when a PR is created.
  - Naming convention: `temporary-pr-XXXX` where `XXXX` is the PR number.
. *Expiration*: These execution environments are ephemeral and will expire after 7 days.
. *Purpose*: These execution environments are solely for testing and should not be used in any production-like environment.

=== 3. Merging and Release Candidate Preparation

. *Merging*: Once testing is completed in the DEV and TEST environments, PRs are merged into the `development` branch.
  - Note: Several PRs can be merged before proceeding to the next step.
. *Release Candidate*: Once enough PRs are merged and it's deemed necessary, a new RC image is cut with a version tag in the form `vX.Y.Z-rc`.
. *Testing Period*: The RC execution environment undergoes thorough testing with several core catalog items.

=== 4. Bug Fixes and Iterative Release Candidates

. *Bug Identification*: If any bugs are found, they are fixed in a new feature or bug-fix branch.
. *New PR*: A new PR is created, tested, and merged as per phases 1 and 2.
. *Iterative Release Candidate*: A new release candidate is cut, incremented to the next rc version, e.g., `vX.Y.Z-rc.2`.

=== 5. Stable Release

. *Final Testing*: The last release candidate is subjected to final testing and validation.
. *Stable Release*: If all tests pass, a stable tag alias is created for the last Release Candidate execution environment, effectively releasing it as a stable version with a new tag in the form `vX.Y.Z`.
  - Note: The stable release is not a new build but an alias to the last release candidate, ensuring that the images are identical.

=== 6. Release Candidate Environment Retention

- Release candidate (`vx.y.z-rc*` tag) execution environments are never deleted and remain accessible for reference or rollback scenarios.

== Notes

- All release candidates are immutable; changes result in a new incremented RC tag.
- Stable releases are tag aliases of the corresponding release candidate, ensuring that both images are identical.
- Release candidates and stable releases should both be tested in environments that are as close to the production environment as possible.
- Strict versioning is followed for traceability and to ensure reproducibility.
