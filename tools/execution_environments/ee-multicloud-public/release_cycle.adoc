= Execution Environment Release Cycle

== Overview

The release cycle for execution environments is designed to go through several stages to ensure quality and stability. These stages include development, automated builds for Pull Requests, alpha releases, and stable releases.

== Release Phases

=== 1. Development

. *Branch Creation*: A feature or bug-fix branch is created based on the `development` branch.
. *Pull Request*: A Pull Request (PR) is submitted, triggering automated build processes.

=== 2. Automated PR Builds

. *Environment Build*: An ephemeral execution environment is automatically built when a PR is created.
  - Naming convention: `pr-XXXX` where `XXXX` is the PR number.
. *Expiration*: These execution environments are ephemeral and will expire after 7 days.
. *Purpose*: These execution environments are solely for testing and should not be used in any production-like environment.

=== 3. Merging and Alpha Release Preparation

. *Merging*: Once testing is completed in the DEV and TEST environments, PRs are merged into the `development` branch.
  - Note: Several PRs can be merged before proceeding to the next step.
. *Alpha Release*: Once enough PRs are merged and it's deemed necessary, a new alpha release is cut with a version tag in the form `vX.Y.Z-alpha`.
. *Testing Period*: The alpha execution environment undergoes thorough testing with several core catalog items.

=== 4. Bug Fixes and Iterative Alpha Releases

. *Bug Identification*: If any bugs are found, they are fixed in a new feature or bug-fix branch.
. *New PR*: A new PR is created, tested, and merged as per phases 1 and 2.
. *Iterative Alpha Release*: A new alpha release is cut, incremented to the next alpha version, e.g., `vX.Y.Z-alpha.2`.

=== 5. Stable Release

. *Final Testing*: The last alpha release is subjected to final testing and validation.
. *Stable Release*: If all tests pass, a stable tag alias is created for the last alpha execution environment, effectively releasing it as a stable version with a new tag in the form `vX.Y.Z`.
  - Note: The stable release is not a new build but an alias to the last alpha release, ensuring that the images are identical.

=== 6. Alpha Environment Retention

- Alpha execution environments are never deleted and remain accessible for reference or rollback scenarios.

== Notes

- All alpha releases are immutable; changes result in a new incremented alpha release.
- Stable releases are tag aliases of the corresponding alpha releases, ensuring that both images are identical.
- Alpha releases and stable releases should both be tested in environments that are as close to the production environment as possible.
- Strict versioning is followed for traceability and to ensure reproducibility.
