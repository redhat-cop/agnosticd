## Requirements

* You can either use an execution environment (preferred) or install all the requirements into a virtual environment
  * Required collections are listed in [requirements.yml](../collections/requirements.yml)
  * Required Python packages are listed in [requirements.txt](../requirements.txt)
  * `ansible-navigator` if you are going to use execution environments

* AWS Account (follow directions in one time setup below)

## Lab Setup

### One Time Setup

[For One Time Setup - click here](../docs/setup.md)

## Ansible-Navigator

If you are going to use ansible-navigator and the workshop execution environment there are two (2) differences from ansible-playbook method used previously:

### 1. AWS Creds for Execution Environments

You need to set your AWS credentials as environment variables.  This is because the execution environment will not have access to your ~/.aws/credentials file.  This is preferred anyway because it matches the behavior in Automation controller.

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA6ABLAH1223VBD3W
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=zh6gFREbvblahblahblahfXIC5nZr51OgdKECaSIMBi9Kc
```

To make environment variables permanent and persistent you can set this to your `~/.bash_rc`.  See Red Hat Knowledge Base article: [https://access.redhat.com/solutions/157293](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/157293)

### 2. Running Ansible-Navigator from the project root

You must run from the project root rather than the `/provisioner` folder.  This is so all the files in the Git project are mounted, not just the provisioner folder.  This is also best practice because it matches the behavior in Automation controller.

For example:

```
ansible-navigator run provisioner/provision_lab.yml -e @provisioner/extra_vars.yml
```

### Setup (per workshop)

* Define the following variables in a file passed in using `-e @extra_vars.yml`

```yaml
---
# region where the nodes will live
ec2_region: us-east-1

# name prefix for all the VMs
ec2_name_prefix: TESTWORKSHOP

# creates student_total of workbenches for the workshop
student_total: 2

# Set the right workshop type, like network, rhel or f5 (see above)
workshop_type: rhel

# Generate offline token to authenticate the calls to Red Hat's APIs
# Can be accessed at https://access.redhat.com/management/api

```
### Automation controller license

In order to use Automation controller (i.e. `controllerinstall: true`), which is the default behavior (as seen in group_vars/all.yml) you need to have a valid subscription via a `manifest.zip` file.  To retrieve your manifest.zip file you need to download it from access.redhat.com.  

- Here is a video by Colin McNaughton to help you retrieve your manifest.zip:
 [https://youtu.be/FYtilnsk7sM](https://youtu.be/FYtilnsk7sM).
- If you need to get a temporary license, get a trial here [http://red.ht/try_ansible](http://red.ht/try_ansible).

**How do you use the manifest.zip with the workshop?**

These are the ways to integrate your license file with the workshop:

1. Put the manifest.zip file into provisioner folder

  The first way is to make sure your license/manifest has the exact name `manifest.zip` and put it into the same folder as the `provision_lab.yml` playbook (e.g.) `<your-path>/workshops/provisioner/manifest.zip`

2. Turn the manifest.zip into a variable

  The second way is to turn the `manifest.zip `into a base64 variable.

  This allows the `manifest.zip` to be treated like an Ansible variable so that it can work with CI systems like Github Actions or Zuul.  This also makes it easier to work with Automation controller, in case you are spinning up a workshop using Automation controller itself.

  To do this use the `base64` command to encode the manifest:

  ```
  base64 manifest.zip > base64_platform_manifest.txt
  ```
  Take the output of this command and set it to a variable `base64_manifest` in your extra_vars file.

  e.g.
  ```
  base64_manifest: 2342387234872dfsdlkjf23148723847dkjfskjfksdfj
  ```

  >**Note**
  >
  >The manifest.zip is substantially larger than the tower.license file, so the base64_manifest base64 might be several hundred lines long if you have text wrapping in your editor.

  >**Note**
  >
  >base64 is not encryption, if you require encryption you need to work within your CI system or Automation controller to encrypt the base64 encoded manifest.zip.

3. Download the manifest.zip from a URL

  If you specify the following variables, the provisioner will download the manifest.zip from an authenticated URL:

  ```
  manifest_download_url: https://www.example.com/protected/manifest.zip
  manifest_download_user: username
  manifest_download_password: password
  ```

### Automating the download of aap.tar.gz 

If you have the aap.tar.gz tarball in a secure URL, you can automate the downloading of it by specifying the following variables.
Note that the tarball specified in the URL must match the SHA value defined in provided_sha_value

  ```
  aap_download_url: https://www.example.com/protected/aap.tar.gz
  aap_download_user: username
  aap_download_password: password
  ```

* [sample-vars-auto_satellite.yml](sample_workshops/sample-vars-auto_satellite.yml) - example for `auto_satellite` workshop. [Read Notes](#automated-satellite)

* Run the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook provision_lab.yml -e @extra_vars.yml
```

* Login to the AWS EC2 console and you will see instances being created.  For example:

```yaml
testworkshop-student1-ansible
````

### Accessing student documentation and slides

* Exercises and instructor slides are hosted at [aap2.demoredhat.com](aap2.demoredhat.com)

* Workbench information is stored in two places after you provision:

  * in a local directory named after the workshop (e.g. testworkshop/instructor_inventory)
  * By default there will be a website `ec2_name_prefix.workshop_dns_zone` (e.g. `testworkshop.rhdemo.io`)

    * **NOTE:** It is possible to change the DNS domain (right now this is only supported via a AWS Route 53 Hosted Zone) using the parameter `workshop_dns_zone` in your `extra_vars.yml` file.
    * **NOTE:** The playbook does not create the route53 zone and must exist prior to running the playbook.

### Accessing instructor inventory

* The instructor inventory will be copied to `/tmp` on student1's control_node as part of the control_nodes role.
* The instructor can see all assigned students and what their workbench is by visiting `ec2_name_prefix.workshop_dns_zone/list.php` (e.g. `testworkshop.rhdemo.io/list.php`)

### DNS

The provisioner currently supports creating DNS records per control node with valid SSL certs using [Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).  Right now DNS is only supported via AWS Route 53, however we are building it in a way that this can be more pluggable and take advantage of other public clouds.

This means that each student workbench will get an individual DNS entry.  For example a DNS name will look like this: `https://student1.testworkshop.rhdemo.io`

* **NOTE:** The variable `dns_type` defaults to `aws`.  This can also be set to `dns_type: none`.
* **NOTE:**  If Lets Encrypt fails, the workshop provisioner will still pass, and alert you of errors in the `summary_information` at the end of the `provision_lab.yml` Ansible Playbook.

### Smart Management

The Smart Management Lab relies on a prebuilt AMI for Red Hat Satellite Server. An example for building this AMI can be found [here](https://github.com/willtome/ec2-image-build).

The Smart Management Lab also requires AWS DNS to be enabled. See [sample vars](./sample_workshops/sample-vars-smart_mgmt.yml) for required configuration.

### Automated Satellite

The Automated Satellite Lab relies on a prebuilt AMI for Red Hat Satellite Server. An example for building this AMI can be found [here](https://github.com/heatmiser/packer-ansible-ec2/tree/satellite-6.12).

The Automated Satellite Lab also requires AWS DNS to be enabled. See [sample vars](./sample_workshops/sample-vars-auto_satellite.yml) for required configuration.
### devcontainer

For convenience, a devcontainer has been configured for use within this project. This setup allows workshop developers to run the workspace along with provisioner within a Docker container. The devcontainer has support for docker-in-docker so that `ansible-navigator` can run against the workshop execution environment to provision workshops. 

See the `devcontainer.json` in the `.devcontainer` directory at the top level of this repository. For more information regarding devcontainers, see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

## Developer Mode and understanding collections

The Ansible Workshops are actually a collection.  Every role is called using the FQCN (fully qualified collection name).  For example to setup the control node (e.g. install Automation controller) we call the role

```
- include_role:
    name: ansible.workshops.control_node
```

This installs locally from Git (versus from Galaxy or Automation Hub).  If the galaxy.yml version **matches** your installed version, it will skip the install (speed up provisioning).  Using `developer_mode: true` if your extra_vars will force installation every time.  This is super common when you are editing a role and want to immediately see changes without publishing the collection.

If you want to contribute to the workshops, check out the [contribution guide](../docs/contribute.md).

## Lab Teardown

The `teardown_lab.yml` playbook deletes all the training instances as well as local inventory files.

To destroy all the EC2 instances after training is complete:

* Run the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook teardown_lab.yml -e @extra_vars.yml
```

* Optionally you can enable verbose debug output of the information gathered that drives the teardown process by passing the extra optional variable `debug_teardown=true`. Example:

```bash
ansible-playbook teardown_lab.yml -e @extra_vars.yml -e debug_teardown=true
```

Note: Replace `ansible-playbook` with `ansible-navigator run` if using `ansible-navigator`.

## Demos

There is a variable you can pass in within your extra_vars named `demo`.  When this keyword is defined it will install the specified demo from the Github repository [https://github.com/ansible/product-demos](https://github.com/ansible/product-demos).h

For example you can put:

```yaml
demo: all
```

Which will install all demos onto the Ansible Tower instance.  Not all demos will work on any `workshop_type`.  Please refer to the [Demo repository list](https://github.com/ansible/product-demos#demo-repository).

## FAQ

For frequently asked questions see the [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)

## More info on what is happening

The `provision_lab.yml` playbook creates a work bench for each student, configures them for password authentication, and creates an inventory file for each user with their IPs and credentials. An instructor inventory file is also created in the current directory which will let the instructor access the nodes of any student.  This file will be called `instructor_inventory.txt`

What does the AWS provisioner take care of automatically?

* AWS VPC creation (Amazon WebServices Virtual Private Cloud)
* Creation of an SSH key pair (stored at ./WORKSHOPNAME/WORKSHOPNAME-private.pem)
* Creation of a AWS EC2 security group
* Creation of a subnet for the VPC
* Creation of an internet gateway for the VPC
* Creation of route table for VPC (for reachability from internet)
