module: agnosticd_user_info

short_description: Display user information for agnosticd deployment and save in output directory

version_added: "2.9"

description:
- This module provides the capability of displaying user information in agnosticd processing while saving the output as a YAML in the output directory.
- Files "user-info.yaml" stores a list of messages to deliver to the environment owner and "user-data.yaml" store structured data.
- Messages and data can be stored for specific users to support multi-user environments.
- The string "user.info: " is prepended to the displayed output for compatibility with the prior practice of using the debug module with this special prefix string.

options:
  msg:
    description:
      - This is the message or data to display.
      - It should be a string.
  data:
    description:
      - Dictionary of data to store.
      - Values may be of any type, deep data structures are discouraged.
      - Subsequent calls to agnosticd_user_info will add new keys and update existing keys.
  user:
    description:
      - User name if data or message should be set for a particular user.
