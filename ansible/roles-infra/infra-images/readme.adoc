<1> see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeImages.html for filters
<2> You can also pass a string. See commonly used predefined dicts in the link:defaults/main.yaml[defaults/main.yaml]. If it's not a predefined dict, then image fallbacks to the mapping in the cloudformation template.

The `agnosticd_images` dictionary is populated automatically and can be used later in infra steps.
