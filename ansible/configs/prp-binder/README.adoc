fail_software
fail_post_software

`ansible-playbook main.yml -e @configs/prp-binder/sample_vars.yml -e '{ "fail_software" : true }'`

== Controlling provision duration

You can control how long it takes this config to complete by enabling a pause during the.

[source,yaml]
----
prp_binder_pause_post_software
prp_binder_pause_post_software_seconds

This step is unnecessary as nothing is actiually created. However the following
will simulate a deletion.


`ansible-playbook destroy.yml -e @configs/prp-binder/sample_vars.yml`
