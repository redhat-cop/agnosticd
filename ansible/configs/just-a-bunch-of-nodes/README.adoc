== Overview

*Three Tier App* _config_  whilst originally intended for the deployment of a three tier app is perhaps better described as "5 un-configured RHEL machines all exposed to the internet".
It is worth noting, despite its name, that no application is actually deployed.
It makes an ideal base infrastructure to build on and can easily be extended via it's `env_vars.yml` to less or more machines and also to different operating system images.

== Supported Cloud Providers


* AWS
* Azure

== Review the Env_Type variable file

The link:./env_vars.yml[./env_vars.yml] file contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your environment.

This includes the ability to:

* Change the number of machines deployed
* Changed the operating system image (e.g. Ansible AMI or similar)
* Change the tags carried by any instances
* Change the base packages installed 
* Change/set the `ansible_user` and `remote_user`

These can be over-ridden at `ansible-playbook` runtime via `-e` options or perhaps more compactly by overriding vars in your own var file and invoking via `-e @my_env_vars.yml`

For further information on customizing images consult the link:../../../docs/Creating_a_config.adoc[Creating a Config Guide] 


== Running Ansible Playbook


You can run the playbook with the following arguments, from the `ansible` directory, to overwrite the default variable values:
[source,bash]
----
REGION=ap-southeast-2
KEYNAME=ocpkey
GUID=praktest2
ENVTYPE="three-tier-app"
CLOUDPROVIDER=ec2
HOSTZONEID='Z3IHLWJZOU9SRT'
BASESUFFIX='.example.opentlc.com'

ansible-playbook main.yml                       \
      -e "guid=${GUID}"                         \
      -e "env_type=${ENVTYPE}"                  \
      -e "key_name=${KEYNAME}"                  \
      -e "subdomain_base_suffix=${BASESUFFIX}"  \
      -e "cloud_provider=${CLOUDPROVIDER}"      \
      -e "aws_region=${REGION}"                 \
      -e "HostedZoneId=${HOSTZONEID}"           \
      -e "email=name@example.com"               \
      -e "output_dir=/tmp/workdir"              \
      -e@../secret.yml -vv

== Environment Overview

This environment is used to deploy any number of RHEL nodes for generic use.
It is also used as an example for new contributors to Agnostic D as an example

== Review the Env_Type variable file

* This file link:./env_vars.yml[./env_vars.yml] contains all the variables you
 need to define to control the deployment of your environment.

== Deploying the Three Tier App Config

You can deploy this config by running the following command from the `ansible`
directory. You will have to provide credentials and adjust settings to your own
environment.

`ansible-playbook -e @configs/three-tier-app/sample_vars.yml main.yml`

=== To Delete an environment
----

ansible-playbook -e @configs/three-tier-app/sample_vars.yml \ 
  configs/three-tier-app/destroy_env.yml
