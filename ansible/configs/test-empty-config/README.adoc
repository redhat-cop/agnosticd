You can deploy this config by running the following command from the `ansible`
directory.

You can force this config to fail at any stage including the cloud provider stage
by setting or passing the appropriate boolean value:

[source,yaml]
----
fail_pre_infra
fail_test_cloud_provider
fail_post_infra
fail_pre_software
fail_software
fail_post_software
----


`ansible-playbook main.yml -e @configs/test-empty-config/sample_vars.yml -e '{ "fail_software" : true }'`

This step is unnecessary as nothing is actiually created. However the following
will simulate a deletion.


`ansible-playbook destroy.yml -e @configs/test-empty-config/sample_vars.yml`
