== Review the Env_Type variable file

The file sample_vars_ec2.yml contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your environment.  Copy this file to my_vars.yml and edit it to your needs.  

`cp ansible/configs/ansible-middleware-workshop/sample_vars_ec2.yml  ansible/configs/ansible-middleware-workshop/my_vars.yml`

== Deploying the Ansible Middleware Workshop Config

You can deploy this config by running the following commands from the `ansible`
directory. You will have to provide credentials and adjust settings to your own
environment.

`export aws_access_key_id=`



`export aws_secret_access_key=`

`ansible-galaxy collection install -r configs/ansible-middleware-workshop/requirements.yml`

ansible-playbook -e @configs/ansible-middleware-workshop/my_vars.yml main.yml --extra-vars "aws_access_key_id=$aws_access_key_id aws_secret_access_key=$aws_secret_access_key"
