== Overview

*ansible-workshop-rhel* is an _AgnosticD Native_ Port of the link:https://github.com/ansible/workshops[Ansible Workshops RHEL Workshop].
The initial iteration supports a single seat (i.e., 1 student), but the codebase includes some appropriate constructs to allow _possible_ future support for a _1 deploy, many seats_ deploy.


=== Supported Cloud Providers (`cloud_provider`)

* AWS EC2           # `cloud_provider: ec2`

[NOTE]
====
OpenStack support should be a relatively simple add, requiring the definition of appropriate:

* Networks
* Security Groups (SGs)
* Instances
* Keys

====

=== Pre-requisites

* AWS Credentials
