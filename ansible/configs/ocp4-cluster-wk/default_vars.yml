###### VARIABLES YOU SHOULD CONFIGURE FOR YOUR DEPLOYEMNT
###### OR PASS as "-e" args to ansible-playbook command

# The name of the agnosticd config to deploy
env_type: ocp4-cluster-wk

# This is an account that must exist in OpenStack.
# It is used to create projects, access, Heat templates
admin_user: opentlc-mgr

# The output_dir holds all of the files generated during the deployment
# This includes generated Heat templates, SSH config, SSH keys
# This must be an absolute path and no vars (like $HOME or ~)
output_dir: /tmp/output_dir

# The {{ guid }} is used everywhere and it is what differentiates otherwise
# identical environments. Make this unique. Usually they are 4 characters, but
# it can be any reasonable length.
guid: notset

# The name of the OpenShift cluster that will be deployed.
# This is primarily used if you want to automate the OpenShift deployment.
cluster_name: cluster-{{ guid }}

# Used to add metadata (tags) to OpenStack objects created
project_tag: "{{ env_type }}-{{ guid }}"

# Why is this config being deployed?
# Some valid: development, ilt, production, event
purpose: development

# This should be overwritten based on the user ordering the catalog item

# This config was written with the expectation of using python3
# Several of the roles that it depends on only work with python2,

# TODO: Decide on whether to use sat or give access to repos directly with key
# This will tell Agnosticd to use either:
# sattelite, rhn, or file for repos

# If using satellite, these are needed:
# satellite_url: satellite.opentlc.com
# satellite_activationkey: # This should be stored in secrets

# If using file, these are needed in addition to the repos_template.j2 file:
osrelease: 4.2.0
repo_version: '4.2'
