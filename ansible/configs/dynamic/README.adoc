= AgnosticD Dynamic Config

This configuration is entirely dynamic.
Without configuration it does nothing, all infrastructure and software need to be configured with variables.

== Variables

`agnosticd_infra_workloads` - List of `include_role` specifications to be used for `localhost` during the infrastructure phase. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/include_role_module.html.
These `include_role` statements are processed from `localhost`.
One of these roles is responsible for using `add_host` to add hosts to the inventory for the AgnosticD software phase.

`agnosticd_software_workloads` - List of `include_role` specifications to be used for hosts during the software phase.
In addition to the standard `include_role` parameters, `group` may be specified.
If `group` is given then this role will only be included for hosts in that group.
