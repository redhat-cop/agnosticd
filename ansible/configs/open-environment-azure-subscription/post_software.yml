          Welcome to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure RHPDS.

This time bound sandbox offers access to experience the Ansible Automation Platform on Azure - Managed Application.  You as a Red Hat associate will be enabled to test, create, and demo this offering!  YOU will help make our customers and account teams successful.

        msg: |
          We have temporarily allocated subscription {{ assignedsubscription.subscriptions[0].subscription_id }} in the redhat0.onmicrosoft.com Azure organization to you.
          You can log into https://portal.azure.com using your Red Hat SSO credentials.
          NOTE: This subscription may default to low quotas and disabled Resource Providers.  You may request quota extensions and enable Resource Providers as needed.
          NOTE: When this OPEN environment is deleted, the subscription will be reallocated to someone else and all of its resource groups will be deleted.  All data will be irrecovably removed.
          Before retiring your OPEN environment, please try to clean up any App Registrations that you have created to reduce clutter in Azure.
          Please regularly back up your data and script your changes in case you need to rebuild.
          Please see this page for more information: https://www.opentlc.com/azure/openenv_sub_based_documentation.html
