## TODO: What variables can we strip out of here to build complex variables?
## i.e. what can we add into group_vars as opposed to config_vars?
## Example: We don't really need "subdomain_base_short". If we want to use this,
## should just toss in group_vars/all.
### Also, we should probably just create a variable reference in the README.md
### For now, just tagging comments in line with configuration file.
