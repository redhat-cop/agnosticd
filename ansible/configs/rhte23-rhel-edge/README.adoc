* OpenStack

== Review the Env_Type variable file

The link:./default_vars.yml[./default_vars.yml] file contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your environment.

This includes the ability to:

* Change the number of machines deployed
* Changed the operating system image (e.g. Ansible AMI or similar)
* Change the tags carried by any instances
* Change the base packages installed 
* Change/set the `ansible_user` and `remote_user`

These can be over-ridden at `ansible-playbook` runtime via `-e` options or perhaps more compactly by overriding vars in your own var file and invoking via `-e @my_env_vars.yml`

For further information on customizing images consult the link:../../../docs/Creating_a_config.adoc[Creating a Config Guide] 

== Deploying the rhte23-rhel-edge Config

You can deploy this config by running the following command from the `ansible`

environment.

`ansible-playbook -e @configs/rhte23-rhel-edge/sample_vars/sample_vars_osp.yml main.yml`
