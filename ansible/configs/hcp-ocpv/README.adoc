= All In One Openshift Installer for Equinix Metal RHPDS Provider

== Overview

*ocp4-equinix-aio* _config_  This config is meant to deploy either a full OpenShift cluster using the BareMetal IPI or several Single Node Openshift Clusters using the BareMetal IPI / In-Place install.
It also provides options to install several products on top of the deployed cluster(s), including ACM, ACS and CNV

This environment is used to deploy any number of OpenShift clusters for generic use.


== Supported Cloud Providers

* Equinix Metal

== Review the `sample_vars-equinix_metal` variable file

The link:./sample_vars-equinix_metal.yml[./sample_vars-equinix_metal.yml] file contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your environment.

This includes the ability to:

* Change the number of workers deployed
* Changed the operating system image (e.g. Ansible AMI or similar)
* Set the deployment type (ipi or sno)
* Enable compact cluster deployment (ipi only)
* Enable extra components (ODF, ACM, ACS, CNV ...)

These can be over-ridden at `ansible-playbook` runtime via `-e` options or perhaps more compactly by overriding vars in your own var file and invoking via `-e @my_env_vars.yml`

== Prepare your python virtualenv to run this playbook

As this playbook have some python requirements, the prefered way to run it is to setup and use a virtualenv : 

----
$ python3 -m venv ansible2.9-python3.6

##In Mac
$ pyenv virtualenv ansible2.9-python3.6


## In Mac, if you find the error " the error: error: pyenv: pip: command not found]", it could because you need pip3, in that case please do:
$ alias pip=pip3

$ source ansible2.9-python3.6/bin/activate
(ansible2.9-python3.6) $ pip install --upgrade pip

## In Mac
$ source /Users/[USER]/.pyenv/versions/ansible2.9-python3.6/bin/activate

## ^replace [USER] with your username or the proper path
----

You will then need to install the required modules inside that virtualenv : 

----
(ansible2.9-python3.6) $ pip3 install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/development/tools/virtualenvs/equinix_metal-ansible2.9-python3.6-2021-07-02.txt

== Running Ansible Playbook

To use this playbook, you will first have to create a ~/secret.yml file with the following content : 

----
# Equinix Metal credentials
equinix_metal_payment_method_id: <your equinix metal payment method id>
equinix_metal_organization_id: <your equinix metal org id>
equinix_metal_api_token: <your equinix metal api token>

# Your unique GUID for the deployment
guid: <enter a guid for the deployment>

# Your pull-secret for openshift
pull-secret: <your pull-secret>
----

=== Deploying the config

You can deploy this config by running the following command from the `ansible`
directory. You will have to provide credentials and adjust settings to your own
environment.
You can run the playbook with the following arguments, from the `ansible` directory, to overwrite the default variable values:

[source,bash]
.Create your own copy of sample_vars.yml
----
cp configs/ocp4-equinix-aio/sample_vars_equinix_metal.yml \
  configs/ocp4-equinix-aio/my_vars.yml
----

[source,bash]
.Edit the variables to enter your pull_secret and set deployment options
----
vi configs/ocp4-equinix-aio/my_vars.yml
----

[source,bash]
.Run agnosticd provision
----
ansible-playbook main.yml \
  -e @configs/ocp4-equinix-aio/my_vars.yml \
  -e @~/secret.yml
----

=== To Delete an environment

To delete an environment, just run `destroy.yml` instead of `main.yml` with the same set of variables.

[source,bash]
.Run agnosticd destroy
----
ansible-playbook destroy.yml \
  -e @configs/ocp4-equinix-aio/my_vars.yml \
  -e @~/secret.yml
----
