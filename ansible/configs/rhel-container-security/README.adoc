= RHEL Container Security



== Overview

*RHEL Container Security * _config_  is used for A Practical Introduction to Container Security Hands-On Lab.
It can easily be extended via it's `env_vars.yml` to accomodate custom needs.

== Supported Cloud Providers


* AWS
* Azure

== Review the Env_Type variable file

The link:./env_vars.yml[./env_vars.yml] file contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your environment.

This includes the ability to:

* Change the number of machines deployed
* Changed the operating system image (e.g. Ansible AMI or similar)
* Change the tags carried by any instances
* Change the base packages installed 
* Change/set the `ansible_user` and `remote_user`

These can be over-ridden at `ansible-playbook` runtime via `-e` options or perhaps more compactly by overriding vars in your own var file and invoking via `-e @my_env_vars.yml`

== Running Ansible Playbook


You can run the playbook with the following arguments, from the `ansible` directory, to overwrite the default variable values:
[source,bash]
----
REGION=ap-southeast-2
KEYNAME=ocpkey
GUID=praktest2
ENVTYPE="rhel-container-security"
CLOUDPROVIDER=ec2
HOSTZONEID='Z3IHLWJZOU9SRT'
BASESUFFIX='.example.opentlc.com'

ansible-playbook main.yml                       \
      -e "guid=${GUID}"                         \
      -e "env_type=${ENVTYPE}"                  \
      -e "key_name=${KEYNAME}"                  \
      -e "subdomain_base_suffix=${BASESUFFIX}"  \
      -e "cloud_provider=${CLOUDPROVIDER}"      \
      -e "aws_region=${REGION}"                 \
      -e "HostedZoneId=${HOSTZONEID}"           \
      -e "email=name@example.com"               \
      -e "output_dir=/tmp/workdir"              \
      -e@../secret.yml -vv

== Environment Overview

This environment is used to deploy any number of RHEL nodes for generic use.
It is also used as an example for new contributors to Agnostic D as an example

== Review the Env_Type variable file

* This file link:./env_vars.yml[./env_vars.yml] contains all the variables you
 need to define to control the deployment of your environment.

== Deploying the Three Tier App Config

You can deploy this config by running the following command from the `ansible`
directory. You will have to provide credentials and adjust settings to your own
environment.

`ansible-playbook -e @configs/three-tier-app/sample_vars.yml main.yml`

=== To Delete an environment
----

ansible-playbook -e @configs/three-tier-app/sample_vars.yml \ 
  configs/three-tier-app/destroy_env.yml
