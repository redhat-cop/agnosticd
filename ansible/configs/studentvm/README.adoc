= Student VM (studentvm)

This config will deploy a simple RHEL 8 VM to multiple cloud providers.
You can choose the cloud provider by passing in the `cloud_provider` var.
The VM can be customized by passing `student-roles`.

The directory `sample_vars` contains a few example configurations.

== Student roles

The AgnosticD directory `ansible/roles-student` contains roles that can be applied to a studentvm. These are designed to be simple and focused on one task.

If a custom student vm is necessary (with special tools for example) it is very easy to create another student role with the necessary customizations and pass that as a paremeter to the studentvm.

== Testing student roles

The playbook `studentvm-role.yml` can be used to test a student role against an existing student vm. This is useful while developing a new role.
