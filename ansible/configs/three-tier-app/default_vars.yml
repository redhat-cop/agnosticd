## TODO: What variables can we strip out of here to build complex variables?
## i.e. what can we add into group_vars as opposed to config_vars?
## Example: We don't really need "subdomain_base_short". If we want to use this,
## should just toss in group_vars/all.
### Also, we should probably just create a variable reference in the README.md
### For now, just tagging comments in line with configuration file.

env_type: three-tier-app 
output_dir: /tmp/workdir                # Writable working scratch directory
email: "{{env_type}}@example.com"
guid: defaultguid
key_name: ocpkey

lab_user: devops                        # Ansible Service Account

###### VARIABLES YOU SHOULD CONFIGURE FOR YOUR DEPLOYEMNT
###### OR PASS as "-e" args to ansible-playbook command

### Common Host settings

# FTL Settings
install_ftl: true
ftl_use_python3: true

# Login Settings
install_ipa_client: false
install_student_user: true

# Do you want to run a full yum update
update_packages: false


## guid is the deployment unique identifier, it will be appended to all tags,
## files and anything that identifies this environment from another "just like it"

# This var is used to identify stack (cloudformation, azure resourcegroup, ...)
project_tag: "{{ env_type }}-{{ guid }}"

# This is where the ssh_config file will be created, this file is used to
# define the communication method to all the hosts in the deployment
deploy_local_ssh_config_location: "{{output_dir}}/"

install_bastion: true
install_common: true

### If you want a Key Pair name created and injected into the hosts,
# set `set_env_authorized_key` to true and set the keyname in `env_authorized_key`
# you can use the key used to create the environment or use your own self generated key
# if you set "use_own_key" to false your PRIVATE key will be copied to the bastion. (This is {{key_name}})
use_own_key: true
env_authorized_key: "{{guid}}key"
ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/{{key_name}}.pem
set_env_authorized_key: true

# Is this running from Red Hat Ansible Tower
tower_run: false

### Azure
# Create a dedicated resourceGroup for this deployment
az_destroy_method: resource_group
az_resource_group: "{{ project_tag }}"

# you can operate differently: if you share on resourceGroup for all you deployments,
# you can specify a different resourceGroup and method:
#az_destroy_method: deployment
#az_resource_group: my-shared-resource-group

###### VARIABLES YOU SHOULD ***NOT*** CONFIGURE FOR YOUR DEPLOYEMNT
###### You can, but you usually wouldn't need to.
ansible_user: ec2-user
remote_user: ec2-user

### Vars that can be removed:

# use_subscription_manager: false
# use_own_repos: false
#If using repo_method: satellite, you must set these values as well.
# satellite_url: satellite.example.com
