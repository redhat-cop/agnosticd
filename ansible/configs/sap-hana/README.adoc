== Overview

*SAP HANA* _config_ will cover the Technical Enablement for 'RHEL for SAP Solutions' related trainning. This is the Techincal Enablement on how to insall SAP HANA on an standalone server, covering automated installation using Ansible and Ansible Tower a well manual installation.

It makes an ideal base infrastructure to build on and can easily be extended via it's `default_vars.yml` to less or more machines and also to different operating system images.

== Review the Env_Type variable file

The link:./env_vars.yml[./env_vars.yml] file contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your environment.

This includes the ability to:

* Change the number of machines deployed
* Changed the operating system image
* Change the tags carried by any instances
* Change the base packages installed
* Change/set the `ansible_user` and `remote_user`

These can be over-ridden at `ansible-playbook` runtime via `-e` options or perhaps more compactly by overriding vars in your own var file and invoking via `-e @my_secret_env_vars.yml`

For further information on customizing images consult the link:../../../docs/Creating_a_config.adoc[Creating a Config Guide]

== Deploying the SAP HANA Config

You can deploy this config by running the following command from the `ansible`
directory. You will have to provide credentials and adjust settings to your own
environment.

`ansible-playbook -e @configs/sap-hana/sample_vars.yml main.yml`

Or ideally using an external not shared vars file where to pass OSP credentials and others

`ansible-playbook -e @my_secret_env_vars.yml main.yml`

=== To Delete an environment
----

ansible-playbook -e @configs/sap-hana/sample_vars.yml \
  configs/sap-hana/destroy_env.yml

Or the custom variables file you used for the deployment:

ansible-playbook -e @my_secret_env_vars.yml \
  configs/sap-hana/destroy_env.yml
