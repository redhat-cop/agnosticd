# # and typically customized for a sucessful deployment.
# #
# # Usage: ansible-playbook main.yml -e @configs/three-tier-app/sample_vars.yml

# # Ideally make and keep a copy OUTSIDE your repo, especially if using Cloud Credentials
# # Credentials can also be set seperately i.e. ~/secrets.yml and passed in with
# # a 2nd `-e` argument i.e. -e ~/secrets.yml
