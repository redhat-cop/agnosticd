== Overview

*SAP SMART* _config_ will cover the workshop 'SAP Smart Management'. This workshop to be used mainly during pre-sales activities, will showcase the `smart management` value of RHEL for SAP Solutions subscription, levaring Satellite and Insights.

It makes an ideal base infrastructure to build on and can easily be extended via it's `default_vars.yml` to less or more machines and also to different operating system images.

* OSP

== Review the Env_Type variable file

The link:./default_vars.yml[./default_vars.yml] file contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your environment.

This includes the ability to:

* Change the number of machines deployed
* Changed the operating system image
* Change the tags carried by any instances
* Change the base packages installed
* Change/set the `ansible_user` and `remote_user`

These can be over-ridden at `ansible-playbook` runtime via `-e` options or perhaps more compactly by overriding vars in your own var file and invoking via `-e @my_secret_env_vars.yml`

For further information on customizing images consult the link:../../../docs/Creating_a_config.adoc[Creating a Config Guide]

== Deploying the SAP SMART Config

You can deploy this config by running the following command from the `ansible`
directory. You will have to provide credentials and adjust settings to your own
environment.

`ansible-playbook -e @configs/sap-smart/default_vars.yml main.yml`

Or ideally using an external not shared vars file where to pass OSP credentials and others

`ansible-playbook -e @my_secret_env_vars.yml main.yml`

=== To Delete an environment
----

ansible-playbook -e @configs/sap-smart/sample_vars.yml \
  configs/sap-destroy/destroy_env.yml

Or the custom variables file you used for the deployment:

ansible-playbook -e @my_secret_env_vars.yml \
  configs/sap-smart/destroy_env.yml
