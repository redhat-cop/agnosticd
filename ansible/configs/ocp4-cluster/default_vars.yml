###### VARIABLES YOU SHOULD CONFIGURE FOR YOUR DEPLOYEMNT
###### OR PASS as "-e" args to ansible-playbook command

# The name of the agnosticd config to deploy
env_type: ocp4-cluster

# The output_dir holds all of the files generated during the deployment
# This includes generated Heat templates, SSH config, SSH keys
# This must be an absolute path and no vars (like $HOME or ~)
output_dir: /tmp/output_dir

# The {{ guid }} is used everywhere and it is what differentiates otherwise
# identical environments. Make this unique. Usually they are 4 characters, but
# it can be any reasonable length.
guid: notset

# The name of the OpenShift cluster that will be deployed.
# This is primarily used if you want to automate the OpenShift deployment.

project_tag: "{{ env_type }}-{{ guid }}"

# Why is this config being deployed? Override for specific environments
# Some valid: development, ilt, production, event
purpose: development

# Enable this if you want to create a user on the bastion

# This config was written with the expectation of using python3

# FTL is used for grading and solving. It will pull in the external ftl-injector role.
# This might be enabled when we have solvers to run or graders for ILT
