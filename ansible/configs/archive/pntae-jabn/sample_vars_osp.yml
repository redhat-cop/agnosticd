#
# This file is passed to ansible-playbook to set key vars which need to be set
# and typically customized for a sucessful deployment.
#
# Usage: ansible-playbook main.yml -e @.../sample_vars.yml
#
# Ideally make and keep a copy OUTSIDE your repo, especially if using Cloud Credentials
# Credentials should be set seperately i.e. ~/secrets.yml and passed in with
# a 2nd `-e` argument i.e. -e ~/secrets.yml
