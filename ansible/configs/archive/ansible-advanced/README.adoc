== Overview

Currently the ans-tower-config is used to deploy as least 2 different labs for
the *Ansible Bootcamp ILT* aka *Ansible Advanced*. The primary differences being
the "normal" version creates the base infrastructure for students to depoly tower
whereas the "homework version" actually deploys and licesnes an Ansible Tower
Cluster and configures it with various objects, e.g. keys, workflows etc, to 
give students a start on their homework.

The "homework" version is deployed when:

+
[source,yaml]
----
deploy_tower_homework: true
----

== NOTES

. There are 2 sets of deployer scripts:
** 
** 
. There are 2 sets of secrets files:
** 
**

The "homework" lab requires additional secrets over and above the usual cloud (AWS)
credentails and repo path. These are traditionally stored on the admin host and 
can be located via the relevant deployer scripts.


== Review the Env_Type variable file

* This file link:./env_vars.yml[./env_vars.yml] contains all the variables you
 need to define to control, or customize, the deployment of your environment. In
normal usage this should not need to be touched or ammended and one-off changes
can be tested by passing vars or var files with `-e` or `-e @my_version_vars.yml`.


== Secrets

As noted above a deploy of the normal lab requires just 3 

== Running Ansible Playbook



You can run the playbook with the following arguments to overwrite the default variable values:
From the `ansible_agnostic_deployer/ansible` directory run
`
