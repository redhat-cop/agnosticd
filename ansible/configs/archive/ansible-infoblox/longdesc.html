    <h1>Ansible Infoblox NIOS 8.5 Lab</h1>

    <p>
      This lab deploys an Infbolox vNIOS 8.5 (NIOS) instance along with Ansible Tower (Tower) and VSCode. This can be used to demonstrate IP Administration (IPAM) or DNS automation with NIOS and Ansible. It can also be used as a sandbox for testing automation workflows with NIOS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working with the lab:
      <ul>
        <li>When writing playbooks, use the infoblox.nios_module collection</li>
        <li>A new custom credential type called NIOS Custom Credentials is created in Tower</li>
        <li>A new credential called nios creds with per-lab connection variables is predefined</li>
        <li>A new inventory called nios will be populated with extra_vars specific to each lab</li>
        <li>Use /var/lib/awx/venv/nios for ANSIBLE ENVIRONMENT in Tower or jobs will fail</li>
        <li>Pass ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3 to your playbook</li>
        <li>A 10.0.0.0/8 network container is automatically added to NIOS</li>
      </ul>
