== Review the Env_Type variable file

The link:./default_vars.yml[./default_vars.yml] file contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your environment.

This includes the ability to:

* Change the number of machines deployed
* Changed the operating system image
* Change the tags carried by any instances
* Change the base packages installed
* Change/set the `ansible_user` and `remote_user`

These can be over-ridden at `ansible-playbook` runtime via `-e` options or perhaps more compactly by overriding vars in your own var file and invoking via `-e @my_secret_env_vars.yml`

== Deploying the SAP RHV Config

You can deploy this config by running the following command from the `ansible`
directory. You will have to provide credentials and adjust settings to your own
environment.

`ansible-playbook main.yml -e @my_secret_env_vars.yml`
