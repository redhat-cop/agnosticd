== Overview

*base-infra* is a Base Architecture for simple infrastructure in the tradition of just-a-bunch-of-nodes.
Differences include:

* Support for validation plays
* Support for local podman based services
* Future skaffold support for dynamis roles per services (a la antomation_controller collections dispatcher)

=== Cloud Support

* AWS via `cloud_provider: ec2`
* Adding other clouds *should* be relatively trivial as this is _just a bunch of instances_ at its core

=== Architecture

* Bastion host (with optional bookbag, showroom, or VSCode Server)

It is designed to support Hybrid Cloud use. In other words the primary infrastructure can be deployed to AWS for example but the automation controller infrastructure could contain credentials allowing it to deploy subsequent infrastructure to other public or private loud infrastructures such as Azure, vSphere, OpenStack, GCP etc.

To provide Hybrid Cloud use cases it is designed to be used in a *chained config* where this `config` simply deploys a simple foundation of AAP2 infrastructure and the Cloud Credentials come from, other, sandbox configs/deploys which are then injected by the `ent-demo-ate-binder`

See the *Developer Notes* below for more details

=== Basic Architecture and Overview

This config uses a number of new roles, and patterns, that differ from older _Ansible Type_ configs:

* New role `bastion-base` - lighter and less crufty than older roles, basically does less
** Supports new packages list `agd_bastion_packages` simplifying bastion only packaging v `common_packages`
** New role `user-create-ansible-service-account`

* RedHat Enterprise Linux `bastion`

== Developers Notes

Tested and developed with:

* Developed on
** Ansible 2.14 - see sample_vars, coming to AgnosticD venvs soon, after optimizations (2023-02-28 tonykay@redhat.com)
* Initial, depreciated, development on Ansible `2.11`
** Venv `agnosticd-ansible-2.11-python-3.8`
** Deployed with `ansible-playbook` (`2.11` as stated above)
** i.e. at this time no work has been done to validate with `ansible-navigator`
** or execution environments though little difficulty (and some gains) are anticipated
* Makes fairly extensive use of software switches aka booleans etc
** Please continue this trend so everything can be turned on and off simply by vars
** `when: install_vscode_server | default(false) | bool`

NOTE: At this writing, March 2023, the AgnosticD `ec2` cloud_provider *no longer* appears to use a number of depreciated or obsolete tasks. See configs `requirements.yaml` to ensure correct collections e.g. `amazon.aws` Laptop developers in particular may need to resolve Collections via `export ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH=...` See *LIfecycle Notes* below for implications and why `config` *currently* needs its own `lifecycle.yml`

=== Style etc.

This `config` attempts to offload virtually all its work into roles and as a general guideline the
configs playbooks (pre_, post etc) should primarily or even exclusively avoid embedding other tasks within the plays. IE these plays should try to limit themselves yo:

. `import_role` or `include_role`
. `set_fact`
.  `agnosticd_user_info`

Pretty much everything else should be a role, protected by a software switch `when: ... default(false) | bool`. It goes without saying these should all be FQCN e.g. `ansible.builtin.set_fact`

=== Makefile

An *optional* `Makefile` is provided as this self-documents how the config deploys from a laptop or similar. It is not an essential part of the process but is extremely useful, a simple `make` will list the functionality and modern shells should offer tab completion. Examples:

* `make deploy|destroy`
* `make ssh-bastion`

=== Development *TIPS*

* The `output_dir` inventory is *GOLD* and speeds up development:
** e.g. `ansible-playbook role-wrapping-playbook-to-test.yml -i /tmp/output_dir/inventory_post_software.yaml -e @~/secrets/secret-aws-ate-no-sandbox.yml`
* Use a virtualenv (venv) *For Now* EE support coming
* Consider using ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH to *hide* more up to date collections you may have installed
** Can be an issue on laptop deployments e.g. you have _latest and greatest_ in`~/.ansible/collections`
** Example, assumes you are in repo root dir: `export ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH=$(pwd)/collections` 

NOTE: In some places this config has started to introduce a `agd_` variable prefix e.g. `agd_install_common` instead of `install_common`. This is to avoid collisions and is arguably a superior practice.

==== Mac Developer Notes

Common Errors, issues

[source,sh]
----
Â fatal: [bastion.base-aap2-01.internal]: FAILED! => {"msg": "crypt.crypt not supported on Mac OS X/Darwin, install passlib python module. crypt.crypt not supported on Mac OS X/Darwin, install passlib python module"}
----

passlib error re crypt
Fix: python3 -m pip install passlib


Fix: If Python dep `PyGObject==3.42.2` fails to install then `brew install gobject-introspection` resolved it for tonykay@redhat.com

== Sample files

* A _typical_ secrets file:

[source,yaml]
----
---
#
# Set cloud provider here as these ties 100% to secrets
#

cloud_provider: ec2

#
# Sandbox creds 2022-07-20
#

aws_access_key_id:                              <YOUR-AWS-SANDBOX-KEY>
aws_secret_access_key:                          <YOUR-AWS-SECRET-ACCESS-SANDBOX-KEY>
subdomain_base_suffix:                          <subdomain from sandbox email, including leading `.`>

#
# Satellite Creds, use labsat-HA and dedicated activation key for isolation
#

repo_method:                                    satellite
set_repositories_satellite_ha:                  true
set_repositories_satellite_url:                 <YOUR-URL>
set_repositories_satellite_org:                 <YOUR-ORG>
set_repositories_satellite_activationkey:       <OBTAIN FROM YOUR ADMIN>

...

=== Totally Optional File 

Whilst developing I, Tony (tok@redhat.com) basically setup my develop environment like this:

. `workon agnosticd-ansible-2.11-python-3.8` # or however you manage venvs
. `source tok-env.sh` in the root directory of AgnosticD

* An example of my `tok-env.sh`:

[source,bash]
----
export ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH=/Users/tok/repos/agnosticd/repo/agnosticd/collections
export ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH=/tmp/output_dir/ate-01
export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=tok-ansible.cfg

export MAKEFILE=$(pwd)/ansible/configs/ent-demo-ate-base/Makefile

# old legacy config
alias mk="make -f $MAKEFILE "
----

NOTE: The above is purely optional but should perhaps help others do laptop based deploys. Also after doing this you can simply `mk dep<TAB>` for example to do a deploy, or `mk ssh-b<TAB>` to ssh to a bastion

=== Common Errors and Mistakes

* Make sure you are using a supported venv and ansible version
