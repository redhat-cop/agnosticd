= All In One Openshift Installer for Equinix Metal RHPDS Provider

== Overview

*ocp4-equinix-aio* _config_  This config is meant to deploy either a full OpenShift cluster using the BareMetal IPI or several Single Node Openshift Clusters using the BareMetal IPI / In-Place install.
It also provides options to install several products on top of the deployed cluster(s), including ACM, ACS and CNV

This environment is used to deploy any number of OpenShift clusters for generic use.


== Supported Cloud Providers

* Equinix Metal

== Review the `default_vars` variable file

The link:./default_vars.yml[./default_vars.yml] file contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your environment.

This includes the ability to:

* Change the number of workers deployed
* Changed the operating system image (e.g. Ansible AMI or similar)
* Set the deployment type (ipi or sno)
* Enable compact cluster deployment (ipi only)
* Enable extra components (ODF, ACM, ACS, CNV ...)

These can be over-ridden at `ansible-playbook` runtime via `-e` options or perhaps more compactly by overriding vars in your own var file and invoking via `-e @my_env_vars.yml`


== Running Ansible Playbook

To get started on OpenStack, please read link:../../../docs/First_OSP_Env_walkthrough.adoc[First OSP Env warlkthrough], it uses a config this derivates from.

=== Deploying the config

You can deploy this config by running the following command from the `ansible`
directory. You will have to provide credentials and adjust settings to your own
environment.
You can run the playbook with the following arguments, from the `ansible` directory, to overwrite the default variable values:

[source,bash]
.Create your own copy of sample_vars.yml
----
cp configs/ocp4-equinix-aio/sample_vars_equinix_metal.yml \
  configs/ocp4-equinix-aio/my_vars.yml
----

[source,bash]
.Run agnosticd provision
----
ansible-playbook main.yml \
  -e @configs/ocp4-equinix-aio/my_vars.yml \
  -e @~/secret.yml
----

=== To Delete an environment

To delete an environment, just run `destroy.yml` instead of `main.yml` with the same set of variables.

[source,bash]
.Run agnosticd destroy
----
ansible-playbook destroy.yml \
  -e @configs/ocp4-equinix-aio/my_vars.yml \
  -e @~/secret.yml
----
