= Cloud Provider plays


Here are the ansible code dealing with Cloud Provisioning. It is separated in three files for each Cloud provider:

* `{{cloud_provider}}_infrastructure_deployment.yml`
+
Provision the environment (instances, VPC, dns, etc) using a template from the config. Ex: for AWS, it's a Cloudformation template.
* `{{cloud_provider}}_ssh_config_setup.yml`
+
Generate SSH config file to access the environment.

* `{{cloud_provider}}_destroy_env.yml`
+
Detroy the environment (instances, VPC, dns, etc).


== Adding a new Cloud Provider

* Steps:
** Add the plays for deployment, SSH config setup and destroy environment.
** Update `../lifecycle.yml` file with the tasks for start/stop/status
*** Create the tasks in a separated file  `../lifecycle_{{cloud_provider}}.yml`
* Update `../setup_runtime.yml` to add the provider to the `agnosticd_cloud_providers` variable
