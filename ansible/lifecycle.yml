# Quickly setup output dir and include vars.
# Do not run the full setup_runtime.yml playbook because
# it installs galaxy dependencies and that is too slow for
# lifecycle actions.
#
# Output dir:
- import_playbook: setup_output_dir.yml

# include global vars from the config
- import_playbook: include_vars.yml


# This file is the default playbook for common actions.
# You should implement those actions in your config if you
# need a specific process.
