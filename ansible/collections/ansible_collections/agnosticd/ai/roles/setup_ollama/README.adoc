This role is entirely self container ie is _fire and forget_ and does not require any variables to be set.

However the following link:./defaults/main.yml[variables] can be set to control the installation:

[source,yaml]

setup_ollama_models: 
----

== Dependencies

None

== Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: Setup Ollama including systemd service
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: true
  become: true

  roles:
    - setup_ollama
