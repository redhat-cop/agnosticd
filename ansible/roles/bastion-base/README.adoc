== Overview

`bastion-base` is an extremely lightweight role designed to purely prepare a `bastion` host with an absolute minimal configuration. IE it does not setup packages for any particular use case such as Ansible, OpenShift, or OpenStack.

Designed to be used in a pattern like this:

roles:

  - bastion-base                    # Common bastion tasks not specific to any end use case
  - bastion-ansible-control-node    # Ansible Control Node specific stuff

=== Functionality

* Installs the contents of the list `agd_bastion_packages`
** This is a departure from the older pattern of installing `common_packages` everywhere
* Setups basic ssh `config` file
* Setups basic ENV VARS: `GUID` in `.bashrc` and `/etc/skel/.bashrc` 
* *Does not* add random packages or customizations that should live elsewhere
** e.g. jq, helm etc...

=== Developer Notes

* Tested with Ansible `2.11`
* Used, and verified, by the `config` `ent-demo-ate-base`
** Originally developed for this to avoid the decaying `bastion-lite` role
* Uses FQCNs (Fully Qualified Collection Names) throughout 
* Based on `bastion-lite`
** i.e. it is `bastion-lite` without some of the cruft
