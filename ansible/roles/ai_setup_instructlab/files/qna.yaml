- answer: InstructLab is a model-agnostic open source AI project that facilitates
    contributions to Large Language Models (LLMs).
    We are on a mission to let anyone shape generative AI by enabling contributed
    updates to existing LLMs in an accessible way. Our community welcomes all those who
    would like to help us enable everyone to shape the future of generative AI.
  question: What is InstructLab?
- answer: Check out the Instructlab Community README to get started
    with using and contributing to the project.
    If you want to jump right in, head to the InstructLab CLI
    documentation to get InstructLab set up and running.
    Learn more about the skills and knowledge you can add to models.
    You may wish to read through the project's FAQ to get more familiar
    with all aspects of InstructLab. You can find all the ways to
    collaborate with project maintainers and your fellow users of
    InstructLab beyond GitHub by visiting our project collaboration page.
  question: How to get started with InstructLab
- answer: There are many projects rapidly embracing and extending
    permissively licensed AI models, but they are faced with three
    main challenges like Contribution to LLMs is not possible directly.
    They show up as forks, which forces consumers to choose a “best-fit”
    model that is not easily extensible. Also, the forks are expensive
    for model creators to maintain. The ability to contribute ideas is
    limited by a lack of AI/ML expertise. One has to learn how to fork,
    train, and refine models to see their idea move forward.
    This is a high barrier to entry. There is no direct community
    governance or best practice around review, curation, and
    distribution of forked models.
  question: What problems is Instructlab aiming to solve?
- answer: InstructLab was created by Red Hat and IBM Research.
  question: Who created Instructlab?
- answer: The project enables community contributors to add
    additional "skills" or "knowledge" to a particular model. InstructLab's
    model-agnostic technology gives model upstreams with sufficient
    infrastructure resources the ability to create regular builds of
    their open source licensed models not by rebuilding and retraining
    the entire model but by composing new skills into it.
    The community welcomes all those who would like to help enable
    everyone to shape the future of generative AI.
  question: How does Instructlab enable community collaboration?
- answer: Yes, InstructLab is a model-agnostic open source AI project
    that facilitates contributions to Large Language Models (LLMs).
  question: Is Instructlab an open source project?
- answer: InstructLab uses a novel synthetic data-based alignment
    tuning method for Large Language Models (LLMs.)
    The "lab" in InstructLab stands for Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots
  question: What is the tuning method for Instructlab?
- answer: The mission of instructlab is to let everyone shape generative AI
    by enabling contributed updates to existing LLMs in an accessible way.
    The community welcomes all those who would like to help enable everyone
    to shape the future of generative AI.
