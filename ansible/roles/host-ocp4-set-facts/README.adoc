:role: host-ocp4-set-facts


Role: {role}
============

The role {role} sets common useful facts for OpenShift clusters:

* `openshift_api_url` - The URL for the API of the cluster
* `openshift_console_url` - The URL the OpenShift console
* `openshift_cluster_ingress_domain` - The `spec.domain` configured the ingress controller.
* `openshift_cluster_ingress_apps_domain` - The `spec.appsDomain` for routes used by the ingress controller.
* `openshift_route_default_domain` - The default route used for routes.

Requirements
------------

This role must be run on a host with an environment pre-authenticated for cluster access.
This could be because the ansible user has a functional kubeconfig or because suitable
environment variables were passed when the role was included.
