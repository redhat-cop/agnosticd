= agnosticd_dynamic

This Ansible role is used during AgnosticD setup to download dynamic sources from Ansible Galaxy and Git.

== Variables

`agnosticd_dynamic_roles_dir` - Directory in which to install Ansible roles.
This directory should be included in the `ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH`, which may be set by the `roles_path` in the `[defaults]` section of `ansible.cfg`.
Default value `{{ playbook_dir }}/dynamic-roles`.

`agnosticd_dynamic_cache_dir` - Directory in which to install sources which should be saved between executions.
Default value `{{ playbook_dir }}/dynamic-cache`, but should be configured outside of the playbook directory to preserve data when executing inside Ansible Tower.

`agnosticd_dynamic_role_galaxy_sources` - List of Ansible Galaxy role sources.
Values are specified as in an Ansible `requirements.yml` (https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/using/installing.html).
If the version is specified with a semantic version syntax then the role source is saved to a cache directory and a link is created from the roles directory.
