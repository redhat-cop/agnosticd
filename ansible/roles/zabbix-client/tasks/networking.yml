# Do not restart iptables services here: if the playbook is run against an already running
# openshift cluster, some specific rules can be set by openshift for containers or routes.
# Restarting iptables service will flush those rules.
# In other words, Stopping and starting iptables.service will destroy configuration that is
# required by OpenShift Container Platform and Docker. OpenShift Container Platform and
# Docker are not notified of the change.
# see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/admin_guide/iptables.html
#
# Instead, just insert the rule to current INPUT chain.
