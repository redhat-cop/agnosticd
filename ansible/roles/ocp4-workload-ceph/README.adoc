= Ceph Workload

This workload deploys and configures Rook Ceph operator on OpenShift 4 cluster. 

== Prerequisite

Before deploying this workload on your OpenShift 4 cluster, make sure you have at least 3 compute / worker nodes running and schedulable. Ceph requires additional EBS volumes attached to each of your worker nodes. This workload creates those volumes using your AWS credentials. Make sure you have access to create at least as many volumes as number of worker nodes in your cluster.
