<h1>OCP Starter Workshop</h1>
<p><i>Starter Workshop</i> is a workshop for a high number of users (<200) that teaches
  how to start developing on OpenShift.

​This workshop walks the audience through​ ​the process​ and concepts of developing an application on OpenShift by creating and
deploying a microservices type of application.</p>

<p>Products and Projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>OpenShift Container Platform</li>
  <li>OpenShift Application Runtimes <br/>(Spring Boot)</li>
  <li>JBoss EAP</li>
</ul>

<p>
  ​This demo deploys all the required infrastructure to deliver the workshop.
  It will create an infrastructure project (ocp-workshop) where you can <find:>
    <ul>
      <li>Nexus (for dependency caching)</li>
      <li>Gogs (for Git hosting)</li>
      <li>Firepad (for user assignment)</li> 
      <li>Workshopper (with all the workshop guides)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Every user will have the required source code in the Gogs platform deployed in the system</p>

<p>Also, every user will have a project already created for them, and they will have quota defined to prevent abuse</p>
