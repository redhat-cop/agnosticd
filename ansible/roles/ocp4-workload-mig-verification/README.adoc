= Cluster Application Migration Workload - OCP 4 Verification

This workload is not intended to be deployed or used stand-alone. It can only be deployed after `ocp4-workload-migration` and `ocp4-workload-ocs-operator` are deployed on an OCP 4 cluster. It only verifies whether all components in Migration Tool are healthy.
