= ocp4-workload-dil-streaming: Day In the Life - Event-driven Workshop

== Role overview

* This is a simple role that does the following:
** Playbook: link:./tasks/pre_workload.yml[pre_workload.yml] - Sets up an
 environment for the workload deployment
*** Adds a user to a list of groups defined in the
 link:./defaults/main.yml[defaults file].
*** Sets a cluster resource quota for the user based on the variables in the
 link:./defaults/main.yml[defaults file] .
*** Debug task will print out: `pre_workload Tasks Complete`

** Playbook: link:./tasks/workload.yml[workload.yml] - Used to deploy the actual
 workload, i.e, 3scale, Mobile or some Demo
*** This role doesn't do anything here
*** Debug task will print out: `workload Tasks Complete`

** Playbook: link:./tasks/post_workload.yml[post_workload.yml] - Used to
 configure the workload after deployment
*** This role doesn't do anything here
*** Debug task will print out: `post_workload Tasks Complete`

== Set up your Ansible inventory file

* You will need to create an Ansible inventory file to define your connection
 method to your host (Master/Bastion with OC command)

* You can also use the command line to define the hosts directly if your `ssh`
 configuration is set to connect to the host correctly

* You can also use the command line to use localhost or if your cluster is
 already authenticated and configured in your `oc` configuration

== Review the defaults variable file

* This file link:./defaults/main.yml[./defaults/main.yml] contains all the variables you
 need to define to control the deployment of your workload.

* You can modify any of these default values by adding
`-e"variable_name=variable_value"` to the command line

=== Deploy Workload on OpenShift Cluster from an existing playbook:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Deploy a workload role on a master host
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: False
  tags:
    - step007
  roles:
    - { role: "{{ocp_workload}}", when: 'ocp_workload is defined' }

----
NOTE: You might want to change `hosts: all` to fit your requirements


=== Deploy a Workload with the `ocp-workload` playbook [Mostly for testing]
----
TARGET_HOST="bastion.eda-f43f.example.opentlc.com"
OCP_USERNAME="hguerrer-redhat.com"
WORKLOAD="ocp4-workload-dil-streaming"
GUID=5432
USER_COUNT=5

# a TARGET_HOST is specified in the command line, without using an inventory file
ansible-playbook -i ${TARGET_HOST}, ./configs/ocp-workloads/ocp-workload.yml \
                 -e"ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa" \
                 -e"ansible_user=${OCP_USERNAME}" \
                    -e"ocp_username=${OCP_USERNAME}" \
                    -e"ocp_workload=${WORKLOAD}" \
                    -e"guid=${GUID}" \
                    -e"num_users=${USER_COUNT}" \
                    -e"ocp_workload_test=true" \
                    -e"ocp_user_needs_quota=true" \
                    -e"ocp_apps_domain=apps.dev311.openshift.opentlc.com" \
