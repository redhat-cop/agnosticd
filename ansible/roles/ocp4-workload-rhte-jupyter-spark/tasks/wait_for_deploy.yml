# Purpose:
#   This script queries OCP for builds that exist but are not yet ready.
#   So long as there are unready builds, this script continues to loop
#
 - name: "Waiting for -l {{ app_to_check }} build to become ready"
   shell: |
          oc -n {{ jupyter_spark_namespace }} get pods -l {{ app_to_check }} -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.containerStatuses[].state.terminated.reason}{"\n"}'

   retries: 60
   delay: 60
