= ocp4-workload-machinesets - Create OpenShift 4 MachineSets

== Role overview

* This role creates additional MachineSets in an OpenShift 4 Cluster. For each MachineSet group it creates a machineset for each availability zone found (if the cloud platform supports availability zones) and then scales the machinesets to the number of replicas desired. Optionally this role also sets up a MachineAutoscaler for the created MachineSet(s). It consists of the following playbooks:
** Playbook: link:./tasks/pre_workload.yml[pre_workload.yml] - Sets up an environment for the workload deployment.
*** Debug task will print out: `pre_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Playbook: link:./tasks/workload.yml[workload.yml] - Used to create the infra nodes
*** Debug task will print out: `workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Playbook: link:./tasks/post_workload.yml[post_workload.yml] - Used to configure the workload after deployment
*** This role doesn't do anything here
*** Debug task will print out: `post_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Playbook: link:./tasks/remove_workload.yml[remove_workload.yml] - Used to delete the workload
*** This role removes the infrastructure nodes (DANGER!!!). It will not remove node selectors from infra components. This will have to be done manually.
*** Debug task will print out: `remove_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

== Review the defaults variable file

* This file link:./defaults/main.yml[./defaults/main.yml] contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your workload.
* The variable *ocp_username* is mandatory to assign the workload to the correct OpenShift user.
* A variable *silent=True* can be passed to suppress debug messages.
* You can modify any of these default values by adding `-e "variable_name=variable_value"` to the command line

=== Deploy a Workload with the `ocp-workload` playbook [Mostly for testing]

TARGET_HOST="bastion.ocp43.openshift.opentlc.com"
OCP_USERNAME="opentlc-mgr"
WORKLOAD="ocp4-workload-machinesets"

# a TARGET_HOST is specified in the command line, without using an inventory file
ansible-playbook -i ${TARGET_HOST}, ./configs/ocp-workloads/ocp-workload.yml \

== Other related information:

=== Deploy Workload on OpenShift Cluster from an existing playbook:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Deploy a workload role on a master host
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: False
  tags:
    - step007
  roles:
    - { role: "{{ocp_workload}}", when: 'ocp_workload is defined' }
----
NOTE: You might want to change `hosts: all` to fit your requirements


=== Set up your Ansible inventory file

* You can create an Ansible inventory file to define your connection method to your host (Master/Bastion with `oc` command)
* You can also use the command line to define the hosts directly if your `ssh` configuration is set to connect to the host correctly
* You can also use the command line to use localhost or if your cluster is already authenticated and configured in your `oc` configuration
