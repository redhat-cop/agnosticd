= `locate_env_authorized_key` role =

This role is used to detect where the env_authorized_key key is located on the provisioning host (localhost).

The main reason is to facilitate the transition of all configs and roles to a common `ssh_provision_key` created by the `create_ssh_provision_key` role that creates also the necessary facts on localhost.

This role, `locate_env_authorized_key`, will use the available keys if found, in order:

* `ssh_provision_key` - created by `create_ssh_provision_key` or re-used existent one
* `infra_ssh_key` - created by OSP heat template
* defaults to `{{ output_dir }}/{{ env_authorized_key }}`
** generally the key is created directly in the config


The role can be included from any host, it will always delegate to the provisioning host (localhost).

== output facts ==

All facts are set on the provisioning host (localhost):

* `env_authorized_key_path`
* `env_authorized_key_path_pub`
* `env_authorized_key_content_pub`
