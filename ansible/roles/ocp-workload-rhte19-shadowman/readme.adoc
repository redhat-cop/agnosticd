= ocp-workload-developer-environment - Sample Config

== Role overview

* This is a simple role that does the following:
** Playbook: link:./tasks/pre_workload.yml[pre_workload.yml] - Sets up an
 environment for the workload deployment
*** Adds a user to a list of groups defined in the
 link:./defaults/main.yml[defaults file].
*** Sets a cluster resource quota for the user based on the variables in the
 link:./defaults/main.yml[defaults file] .
*** Debug task will print out: `pre_workload Tasks Complete`

** Playbook: link:./tasks/workload.yml[workload.yml] - Used to deploy the actual
 workload, i.e, 3scale, Mobile or some Demo
*** This role doesn't do anything here
*** Debug task will print out: `workload Tasks Complete`

** Playbook: link:./tasks/post_workload.yml[post_workload.yml] - Used to
 configure the workload after deployment
*** This role doesn't do anything here
*** Debug task will print out: `post_workload Tasks Complete`

== Review the defaults variable file

* This file link:./defaults/main.yml[./defaults/main.yml] contains all the variables you
 need to define to control the deployment of your workload.

* You can modify any of these default values by adding
`-e"variable_name=variable_value"` to the command line

=== Deploy Workload on OpenShift Cluster from an existing playbook:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Deploy a workload role on a master host
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: False
  tags:
    - step007
  roles:
    - { role: "{{ocp_workload}}", when: 'ocp_workload is defined' }

----
NOTE: You might want to change `hosts: all` to fit your requirements


=== Set up your Ansible inventory file

* You can create an Ansible inventory file to define your connection
 method to your host (Master/Bastion with OC command)

* You can also use the command line to define the hosts directly if your `ssh`
 configuration is set to connect to the host correctly

* You can also use the command line to use localhost or if your cluster is
 already authenticated and configured in your `oc` configuration
