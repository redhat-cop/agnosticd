    # - endpoints -> use endpoints

    # lock; 15 seconds is the value used by core kubernetes controllers.

    # renewDeadline is how long a leader will try to renew the lease before
    # giving up; 10 seconds is the value used by core kubernetes controllers.
    renewDeadline: "10s"
    # retryPeriod is how long the leader election client waits between tries of
    # actions; 2 seconds is the value used by core kuberntes controllers.
    retryPeriod: "2s"
    # enabledComponents is a comma-delimited list of component names for which
    # leader election is enabled. Valid values are:
