----
ansible-playbook -c local -i ${TARGET_HOST}, configs/ocp-workloads/ocp-workload.yml \
      -e ansible_python_interpreter=/opt/app-root/bin/python \
      -e ocp_workload=${WORKLOAD} \
      -e guid=${GUID} \
      -e project_name=${WORKSHOP_PROJECT} \
      -e ocp_username=${OCP_USERNAME} \
      -e ACTION="create"
----

=== To Delete an environment
----
ansible-playbook -c local -i ${TARGET_HOST}, configs/ocp-workloads/ocp-workload.yml \
      -e ansible_python_interpreter=/opt/app-root/bin/python \
      -e ocp_workload=${WORKLOAD} \
      -e guid=${GUID} \
