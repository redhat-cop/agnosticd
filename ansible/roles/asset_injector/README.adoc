== asset_injector

Injects assets, or artifacts, into a target host. Assets can be sourced from a variety of locations, including git, http, templates, and local files.

=== Capabilities

* Inject assets from:
** git
** http
** templates
** local files
* Remove files and directories 
* Insert blocks into files (eg insert a block of text into a config file)
* Manage services (eg restart a service after injecting new assets or configuration)
* Change capabilities

=== Requirements

N/A - these are basic ansible modules that should be available in any ansible installation.

(Future support for say `S3` bucket objects will require the `amazon.aws` collection to be installed for example)

=== Role Variables

Only 1 var `asset_injector_assets ` is required, which is a list of assets to inject. Each asset is a dictionary with the following keys:

[source,yaml]

=== Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: servers
  tasks:

    - name: Inject assets
      when: 
        - asset_injector_asset is defined
        - asset_injector_asset | length > 0
      include_role: 
        name: asset_injector
