TARGET_HOST="bastion.na311.openshift.opentlc.com"
OCP_USERNAME="rorai-redhat.com"
WORKLOAD="ocp4-workload-upgrade-cluster"
GUID=1001

# a TARGET_HOST is specified in the command line, without using an inventory file
ansible-playbook -i ${TARGET_HOST}, ./configs/ocp-workloads/ocp-workload.yml \
    -e"ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/keytoyourhost.pem" \
    -e"ansible_user=ec2-user" \

    -e"ocp_workload=${WORKLOAD}" \

=== Deploy Workload on OpenShift Cluster from an existing playbook:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Deploy a workload role on a master host
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: False
  tags:
    - step007
  roles:
    - { role: "{{ocp_workload}}", when: 'ocp_workload is defined' }
----
NOTE: You might want to change `hosts: all` to fit your requirements


=== Set up your Ansible inventory file

* You can create an Ansible inventory file to define your connection method to your host (Master/Bastion with `oc` command)
* You can also use the command line to define the hosts directly if your `ssh` configuration is set to connect to the host correctly
* You can also use the command line to use localhost or if your cluster is already authenticated and configured in your `oc` configuration
