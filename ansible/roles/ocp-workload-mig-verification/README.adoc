= Cluster Application Migration Workload - OCP 3 Verification

This workload is not intended to be deployed or used stand-alone. It can only be deployed after `ocp-workload-migration` is deployed on an OCP 3 cluster with Gluster storage enabled. It only verifies whether all components in Migration Tool are healthy.
