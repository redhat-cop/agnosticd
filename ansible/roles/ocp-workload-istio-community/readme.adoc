== NOTES

. Using a version of oc utility that corresponds to your target OCP cluster, ensure oc utility is already authenticated as the cluster-admin:   opentlc-mgr
. This workload provisions a single Istio environment in an OCP cluster.
. The OCP namespace for istio will be owned by a non-existant user: admin1
.. admin1 will be assigned a clusterquota so as to manage limits and requests assigned to Istio
. This workload only needs to be executed once per OCP cluster
