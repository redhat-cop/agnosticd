= ocp4_workload_logging - Deploy cluster logging into OCP4

== Role overview

* This role deploys cluster logging into an OpenShift 4 Cluster. Optionally it can use existing Infra or Elasticsearch nodes (run `ocp4_workload_machinesets` workload first).
It consists of the following playbooks:
** Playbook: link:./tasks/pre_workload.yml[pre_workload.yml] - Sets up an environment for the workload deployment.
*** Debug task will print out: `pre_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Playbook: link:./tasks/workload.yml[workload.yml] - Used to deploy logging
*** Debug task will print out: `workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Playbook: link:./tasks/post_workload.yml[post_workload.yml] - Used to configure the workload after deployment
*** This role doesn't do anything here
*** Debug task will print out: `post_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Playbook: link:./tasks/remove_workload.yml[remove_workload.yml] - Used to delete the workload
*** This role removes the logging deployment and project but not the operator configs
*** Debug task will print out: `remove_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

== Review the defaults variable file

* This file link:./defaults/main.yml[./defaults/main.yml] contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your workload.
* The variable *ocp_username* is mandatory to assign the workload to the correct OpenShift user.
* A variable *silent=True* can be passed to suppress debug messages.
* You can modify any of these default values by adding `-e "variable_name=variable_value"` to the command line
