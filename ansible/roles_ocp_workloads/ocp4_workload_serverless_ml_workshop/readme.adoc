=== Deploy a Workload with the `ocp-workload` config [Mostly for testing]

Create a file `workload_vars.yaml` with your variables:
----
cloud_provider: none
env_type: ocp-workloads
target_host: bastion.dev4.openshift.opentlc.com

ocp_workloads:
- ocp4_workload_serverless_ml_workshop

#become_override: false

# If the ocp-workload supports it, you should specify the OCP user:
ocp_username: system:admin

# Usually the ocp-workloads want a GUID also:
guid: changeme
----

From the Agnosticd/ansible directory run the playbook:

----
ansible-playbook main.yml -e @workload_vars.yml -e ACTION="create"
----

=== To Delete an environment

From the Agnosticd/ansible directory run the playbook:
