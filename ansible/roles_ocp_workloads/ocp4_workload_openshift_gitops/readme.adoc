= ocp4_workload_gitops - Deploy OpenShift GitOps to an OpenShift Cluster

[WARNING]
This role is dependent on the OpenShift Pipelines Operator. Make sure to install the pipelines operator *BEFORE* installing this one.

== Role overview

* This role installs OpenShift GitOps into an OpenShift Cluster. It consists of the following tasks files:
** Tasks: link:./tasks/pre_workload.yml[pre_workload.yml] - Sets up an
 environment for the workload deployment.
*** Debug task will print out: `pre_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Tasks: link:./tasks/workload.yml[workload.yml] - Used to deploy OpenShift GitOps
*** This role creates a namespace (project) and deploys the operator.
*** Debug task will print out: `workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Tasks: link:./tasks/post_workload.yml[post_workload.yml] - Used to
 configure the workload after deployment
*** This role doesn't do anything here
*** Debug task will print out: `post_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Tasks: link:./tasks/remove_workload.yml[remove_workload.yml] - Used to
 delete the workload
*** This role removes OpenShift GitOps. Note that it *does not remove the pipelines operator*.
*** Debug task will print out: `remove_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

== Review the defaults variable file

* This file link:./defaults/main.yml[./defaults/main.yml] contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your workload.
* The variable *ocp_username* is mandatory to assign the workload to the correct OpenShift user.
* A variable *silent=True* can be passed to suppress debug messages.


=== Deploy a Workload with the `ocp-workload` config [Mostly for testing]

Create a file `workload_vars.yaml` with your variables:
----
cloud_provider: none
env_type: ocp-workloads
target_host: bastion.dev4.openshift.opentlc.com

ocp_workloads:
- ocp4_workload_gitops

#become_override: false

# If the ocp-workload supports it, you should specify the OCP user:
ocp_username: system:admin

# Usually the ocp-workloads want a GUID also:
guid: changeme-
----

From the Agnosticd/ansible directory run the playbook:

----
ansible-playbook main.yml -e @workload_vars.yml -e ACTION="create"
----

=== To Delete an environment

From the Agnosticd/ansible directory run the playbook:

----
ansible-playbook main.yml -e @workload_vars.yml -e ACTION="remove"
