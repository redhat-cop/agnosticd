<p>Deploying Todo App with OpenShift pipelines and ArgoCD.</p>

<p>
    This is a simple TODO application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks from a database. The application is built using the Quarkus framework, which is a Kubernetes-native Java framework. The application is also packaged as a Helm chart, which makes it easy to deploy and manage on Kubernetes.

    The application uses Quay, ArgoCD, and OpenShift Pipelines to automate the deployment and management of the application. Quay is a container registry that is used to store the application's Docker images. ArgoCD is a continuous delivery tool that is used to deploy the application to Kubernetes. OpenShift Pipelines is a CI/CD platform that is used to automate the build, test, and deploy of the application.</a>. The demo covers the following topics:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Quarkus is a modern, lightweight Java framework that is well-suited for Kubernetes.</li>
    <li>Helm is a popular package manager for Kubernetes that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications.</li>
    <li>Quay is a secure and reliable container registry.</li>
    <li>ArgoCD is a powerful continuous delivery tool that can automate the deployment of applications to Kubernetes.</li>
    <li>OpenShift Pipelines is a comprehensive CI/CD platform that can automate the build, test, and deploy of applications.</li>
  </ul>
