# Modern cloud-native Java runtimes performance monitoring on Red Hat OpenShift

This is the **AgnosticD** role for the *Modern cloud-native Java runtimes performance monitoring on Red Hat OpenShift* Lab.

In this lab, we'll provide an intro-level, hands-on session on application performance using three different cloud-native Java runtimes: Quarkus, SpringBoot, and Micronaut. We'll be building a simple microservice using these three runtimes, packaging them as containers, and deploying them on top of Red Hat OpenShift. Finally, we'll be analyzing and monitoring CPU load as well as memory usage of each variant using some of the capabilities provided by Red Hat OpenShift Platform, like Prometheus and Grafana. We'll conclude by establishing a baseline, so you can see the impact of scaling out or scaling up containers.

In this session lab, you will:

 * Create your own GitHub repository based on a GitHub template.
 * Develop a microservice that consumes CPU and memory using three different Java Stacks: Quarkus, SpringBoot, and Micronaut.
 * Build each microservice as a container.
 * Run these microservices locally.
 * Deploy to your Red Hat OpenShift project (namespace).
 * Execute and monitor using different performance parameters.
 * Load test the microservices.
 * Analyze CPU load and scale containers appropriately.
 * Analyze memory and scale containers appropriately.

> Note: This is a BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) lab.
