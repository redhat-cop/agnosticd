<h1> Fraud Detection Usecase leveraging Red Hat OpenShift Data Science </h1>
    <p>
      The problem of detecting fraudulent transactions is intriguing for a
       Data Scientist. However, the overhead of setting up the technologies
       around it can be cumbersome, this is where Red Hat Data Science (RHODS)
       along with its partners like Starburst and  products like Intel OpenVino
       comes to rescue so that Data scientists can focus on what they do best 
      which is to focus on the Model (training and crafting) and let RHODS 
      focus on what we do best which is to enable Data Scientists with the 
      tools they use the most with the least overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hands-on lab deploys RHODS and configures Starburst. Lab activities
      include: 
      <ul>
        <li>Creating RHODS Data Science Project</li
        <li>Accessing the Starburst Web UI to do Data Preprocessing</li>
        <li>Train and Test a ML model</li>
        <li>Deploy model as a service</li>
      </ul>
      You will leave the workshop with an understanding of how to develop, test 
      and train machine learning workloads using open source tools and Red Hat 
      OpenShift Data Science.
