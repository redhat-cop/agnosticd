Role to deploy Showroom to OpenShift

* No need for cluster admin

* Deploys to shared cluster if shared cluster creds are included

* Deploys to named cluster when showroom_cluster is defined

* runs ONLY on the controller
* uses helm chart and file ./user_data.yml to deploy single or multi-user.


## Multi Users, OpenShift

* provisioning data which is multi-user is (it seems to me) exclusively generated by OpenShift catalog items, when it generates mulitple users in the htpasswd (or other) authN system in a single OpenShift cluster.

* need the showroom service account
* need the showroom namespace to run helm
