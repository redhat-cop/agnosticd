# If your workload needs customization options provide variables to be used.
# Variable names must be prefixed by the role name "<role name>_<variable>".
# Therefore because this example workload is called "ocp4_workload_example" the variables
# should be named "ocp4_workload_example_variable".
#
# You can override the defaults as parameters to the Ansible run that runs
# your workload.

# Documentation for variable 1 (what does it do?)
ocp4_workload_example_variable_1: "value 1"

# Documentation for variable 2 (what does it do?)
ocp4_workload_example_variable_2: "value 2"
