# ocp_username can be set by the provisioner if the workload is applied to a
# shared cluster to set up for the requesting user.
# The default, "system:admin", is not used for roles that are deployed as part of a whole
# OpenShift cluster provision run.
ocp_username: "system:admin"

# If your workload needs customization options provide variables to be used.
#
# Variable names must be prefixed by the role name, e.g. "<role name>_<variable>".
#
# Therefore because this example workload is called "ocp4_workload_example" the variables
# must be named "ocp4_workload_example_variable".
#
# You can override the defaults as parameters to the Ansible run that deploys
# your workload via the AgnosticV configuration.

# Documentation for variable 1 (what does it do? what are valid options?)
ocp4_workload_example_variable_1: "value 1"

# Documentation for variable 2 (what does it do? what are valid options?)
ocp4_workload_example_variable_2: "value 2"
