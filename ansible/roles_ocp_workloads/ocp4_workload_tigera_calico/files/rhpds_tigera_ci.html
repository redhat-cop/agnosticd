    <h2>Implementing Zero-Trust Security for Containers with Tigera Calico </h2>
    <p>
      In this Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) workshop, you will work with Tigera Calico and OpenShift to implement Zero-Trust security for workloads running on OCP. This 90-minute hands-on lab comes with your own Calico environment. 
   </p>
  <p>
Calico Enterprise is the industryâ€™s only active Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) with full-stack observability for containers and Kubernetes. Calico Enterprise extends the declarative nature of Kubernetes to specify security and observability as code. This ensures consistent enforcement of security policies and compliance and provides observability for troubleshooting across multi-cluster, multi-cloud and hybrid deployments.
