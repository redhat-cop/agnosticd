= ocp4_workload_serverless - Deploy OpenShift Serverless (KNative Serving) to OpenShift

== Role overview

* This role installs OpenShift Serverless (backed by KNative) into an OpenShift Cluster. It consists of the following playbooks:
** Playbook: link:./tasks/pre_workload.yml[pre_workload.yml] - Sets up an
 environment for the workload deployment.
*** Debug task will print out: `pre_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Playbook: link:./tasks/workload.yml[workload.yml] - Used to deploy OpenShift Serverless
*** This role creates a namespace (project) and deploys the operator. It will then create the KNativeServing object that deploys the controllers etc.
*** Debug task will print out: `workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Playbook: link:./tasks/post_workload.yml[post_workload.yml] - Used to
 configure the workload after deployment
*** This role doesn't do anything here
*** Debug task will print out: `post_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Playbook: link:./tasks/remove_workload.yml[remove_workload.yml] - Used to
 delete the workload
*** This role removes OpenShift Serverless
*** Debug task will print out: `remove_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

== Review the defaults variable file

* This file link:./defaults/main.yml[./defaults/main.yml] contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your workload.
* The variable *ocp_username* is mandatory to assign the workload to the correct OpenShift user.
* A variable *silent=True* can be passed to suppress debug messages.
