= ocp4_workload_quay_operator - Deploy Red Hat Quay Registry via the Quay Operator

== Role overview

* This role can
** install the Quay Operator
** use a previously installed Red Hat Quay Operator to deploy a Quay Registry into an OpenShift Cluster.
* The cluster *must* have OpenShift Container Storage installed.

* The role consists of the following tasks files:
** Tasks: link:./tasks/pre_workload.yml[pre_workload.yml] - Sets up an
 environment for the workload deployment.
*** Debug task will print out: `pre_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Tasks: link:./tasks/workload.yml[workload.yml] - Used to deploy Red Hat Quay Registry Operator
*** This role creates a namespace (project), operator and a Quay instance
*** Debug task will print out: `workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Tasks: link:./tasks/post_workload.yml[post_workload.yml] - Used to
 configure the workload after deployment
*** This role doesn't do anything here
*** Debug task will print out: `post_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Tasks: link:./tasks/remove_workload.yml[remove_workload.yml] - Used to
 delete the workload
*** This role removes the Red Hat Quay Registry project (and therefore Red Hat Quay Registry)
*** Debug task will print out: `remove_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

== Review the defaults variable file

* This file link:./defaults/main.yml[./defaults/main.yml] contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your workload.
* The variable *ocp_username* is mandatory to assign the workload to the correct OpenShift user.
* A variable *silent=True* can be passed to suppress debug messages.
* You can modify any of these default values by adding `-e "variable_name=variable_value"` to the command line
