# Cloud-native Integration with Red Hat build of Apache Camel

This is the **AgnosticD** role for the *Cloud-native Integration with Red Hat build of Apache Camel* workshop.

More than ever system integration challenges are part of any organization architecture. From integrating legacy applications, to connecting cloud services from different providers, integrations need to be built to allow complex architectures to work and scale. In this lab you will learn how to use Red Hat build of Apache Camel to solve the most common integration challenges when creating solutions. Through different exercises you will also see how to leverage other components from Red Hat Application Foundation to rapidly build reliable and scalable integration apps in a cloud-native development environment. 

> Note: This is a BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) lab.
