= ocp4_workload_pntae - PnTAE File Injection Role

== Role overview

* This role copies a binary grading script onto the bastion host's `/usr/local/bin` named based on the `ocp4_workload_pntae_course_id` variable.
* The script is named the same string as the catalog item in opentlc and stored in the `tasks/files/` folder

== The defaults variable file

* This file link:./defaults/main.yml[./defaults/main.yml] contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your workload.
* The variable *ocp_username* is mandatory to assign the workload to the correct OpenShift user.
* A variable *silent=True* can be passed to suppress debug messages.
* The variable `ocp4_workload_pntae_course_id` must be set to the course id (For example, cee-cf-110)
* Your deployer will override any of these variables (usually CloudForms)
* Add long-name scoped workload parameters. Example: `ocp4_workload_example_machineconfigpool_name: worker`
