= ocp4_workload_windows_node - Deploy a Windows Node to OpenShift

== Role overview

* This role installs a Windows node (backed by OVNKubernetes) into an OpenShift Cluster. It consists of the following tasks files:
** Tasks: link:./tasks/pre_workload.yml[pre_workload.yml] - Sets up an
 environment for the workload deployment.
*** Debug task will print out: `pre_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Tasks: link:./tasks/workload.yml[workload.yml] - Used to deploy a Windows node
*** This role creates a namespace (project) and deploys the operator. It will then create the Windows Node via a MachineSet
*** Debug task will print out: `workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Tasks: link:./tasks/post_workload.yml[post_workload.yml] - Used to
 configure the workload after deployment
*** This will undo some of the pre_workload tasks
*** Debug task will print out: `post_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

** Tasks: link:./tasks/remove_workload.yml[remove_workload.yml] - Used to
 delete the workload
*** This role removes the Windows node
*** Debug task will print out: `remove_workload Tasks completed successfully.`

== Review the defaults variable file

* This file link:./defaults/main.yml[./defaults/main.yml] contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your workload.
* The variable *ocp_username* is mandatory to assign the workload to the correct OpenShift user.
* A variable *silent=True* can be passed to suppress debug messages.
