== FAQ

=== Deployment Stages

==== Can I bypass one or more stages?
Yes, `main.yml` tags each stage, use `--skip-tags`

==== Where should I store credentails?
Never inside the repo. A common pattern is to store them in the home directoy
of the user who executes `ansible-playbook`. For example `~/.ssh` for ssh keys, 
`~/.aws/credentials` for AWS etc.

===  Cloud Providers

==== Can I bypass Stage 1 Cloud Providers completely?
Yes. See `configs/linklight/README` for an example and use `--skip-tags=deploy_infrastructure`

=== AWS Questions

==== Can I use AWS Profiles?

Maybe...
