=== Deployment Stages

Q. Can I bypass one or more stages
A. Yes, `main.yml` tags each stage, use `--skip-tags`

Q. Where should I store credentails
A. Never inside the repo. A common pattern is to store them in the home directoy
of the user who executes `ansible-playbook`. For example `~/.ssh` for ssh keys, 
`~/.aws/credentials` for AWS etc.

A. Yes. See `configs/linklight/README` for an example and use `--skip-tags=deploy_infrastructure`
