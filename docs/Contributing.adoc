=== Git

Please follow the <<gitstyle,Git style guide>>.

Note: during the review process, you may add new commits to address review comments or change existing commits. However, before getting your PR merged, please squash commits to a minimum set of meaningful commits.

If you've broken your work up into a set of sequential changes and each commit pass the tests on their own then that's fine. If you've got commits fixing typos or other problems introduced by previous commits in the same PR, then those should be squashed before merging.
