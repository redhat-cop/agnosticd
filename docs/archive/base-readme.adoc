= Ansible Agnostic Deployer

Ansible Agnostic Deployer (AAD) is a 6 Stage Cloud Deployer for deploying application environments, labs, workshops etc.
Well designed environments, called _configs_, can be easily abstracted to allow deployment to multiple different Public and Private Clouds including AWS, Azure, and others.

This document gives a brief overview of the project function, and structure.
It also provides a guide to the more comprehensive documentation set provided in the `docs/` directory.

== Basic Structure

The repository contains various Ansible playbooks, templates, and other support
files used to provision different software (OpenShift, Ansible Tower, ...) onto 
Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, Ravello, ...). The key files and directories include:


* `./docs/` Start here
* `./ansible` The execution environment
* `./ansible/main.yml` The entry point for a deployment
* `./ansible/configs` Home to the _configs_ to deploy

The Contributors Guides explore the relevant structures in significantly more detail:

* link:docs/Creating_a_config.adoc[Creating a Config]
* link:docs/Creating_a_cloud_deployer.adoc[Creating a Cloud Deployer]

== Overview of Ansible Agnostic Deployer Flow

image::docs/images/agnosticd_flow.png[width=100%]


AAD deployments start by invoking a common `main.yml` with environmental
variables identifying the _config_ and the cloud platform to deploy plus other meta-data.

e.g. `ansible-playbook main.yml -e "env_type=three-tier-app cloud_provider=aws"`

.*Simplified execution flow of `main.yml`
[source,bash]
----
- import_playbook: "configs/{{ env_type }}/pre_infra.yml"
- import_playbook: "cloud_providers/{{ cloud_provider }}_infrastructure_deployment.yml"
- import_playbook: "configs/{{ env_type }}/post_infra.yml"
- import_playbook: "configs/{{ env_type }}/pre_software.yml"
- import_playbook: "configs/{{ env_type }}/software.yml"
- import_playbook: "configs/{{ env_type }}/post_software.yml"
----

For _config_ developers the above stages provide 5 _hooks_ for customizing the configuration of your environment and 1 _hook_ for customizing it for one or more cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, etc).

An _Example config_ is provided by `ansible/configs/just-some-nodes-example`

[TIP]
====
To understand the 6 stages in depth and how to create your own _config_ or copy and modify an existing _config_ please see the link:docs/Creating_a_config.adoc[Creating a Config Developers Guide] for more detail.

== Prerequisites

There are several prerequisites for using this repository, scripted and detailed instructions for usage are available in the following the link:./docs/Preparing_your_workstation.adoc[Preparing Your Workstation] document.
   [estimated effort 5-10 minutes]

* Software required on provisioning workstation:
- https://www.python.org[Python] version 2.7.x (3.x untested and may not work)
- http://docs.pythonboto.org[Python Boto] version 2.41 or greater
- http://github.com[Git] any version would do.
- https://github.com/ansible/ansible[Ansible] version 2.1.2 or greater
 with version 1.11.32
* AWS
** https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip[awscli bundle] tested
** Credentials and Policies:
*** AWS user account with credentials to provision resources
*** A route53 link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/CreatingHostedZone.html[public hosted zone]
  is required for the scripts to create the various DNS entries for the
  resources it creates. The "HostedZoneId" will need to be provided in the
  variable file.
*** An EC2 SSH keypair should be created in advance and you should save the key
    file to your system. (command line instructions can be found in the
       link:./docs/Preparing_your_workstation.adoc[Preparing Your Workstation] document.)

== Standard Configurations

* Several "Standard Configurations" are included in this repository.
* A "Standard Configurations" or "Config" are a predefined deployment examples
 that can be used or copied and modified by anyone.
* A "Config" will include all the files, templates, pre and post playbooks that
 a deployment example requires to be deployed.
* "Config" specific Variable files will be included in the "Config" directory as
 well.

NOTE: Until we implement using Ansible Vault, each "Config" has two vars files
 `_vars` and `_secret_vars`. The `example_secret_vars` file shows the format for
  what to put in your `CONFIGNAME_secret_vars` file.

== Running the Ansible Playbooks

Once you have installed your prerequisites and have configured all settings and files, simply run Ansible like so:

----
ansible-playbook -i 127.0.0.1, ansible/main.yml -e "env_type=config-name" -e "aws_region=ap-southeast-2" -e "guid=youruniqueidentifier"

----

NOTE: Be sure to exchange `guid` for a sensible prefix of your choosing.

For "opentlc-shared" standard config, check out the link:./ansible/configs/ocp-workshop/README.adoc[README] file

== Cleanup (Reference Only)

NOTE: S3 Buckets are now part of a CloudFormation stack and are properly deleted before the stack in the destroy playbooks.  
* S3 Bucket
- (Reference Only) An S3 bucket is used to back the Docker registry. AWS will not let you delete a
non-empty S3 bucket, so you must do this manually. The `aws` CLI makes this
easy:
+
----
aws s3 rm s3://bucket-name --recursive
----

- Your bucket name is named `{{ env_type }}-{{ guid }}`. So, in the case of a
`bu-workshop` environment where you provided the `guid` of "Atlanta", your S3
bucket is called `bu-workshop-atlanta`.

* CloudFormation Template
- If `destroy_env.yml` playbook failed, just go into your AWS account to the CloudFormation section in the region where
you provisioned, find the deployed stack, and delete it.

* SSH config
- This Ansible playbook creates a SSH config for the environment you are provisioning. It is created in `ansible/workdir` directory. The file is then used by ansible to access the environment.

== Troubleshooting

Information will be added here as problems are solved. So far it's pretty
vanilla, but quite slow. Expect at least 40 min for a full OpenShift deployment. Some configs are faster.

=== Use stable tags
Configs are tested on a regular basis. Once it works, a release (tag) for this config is created. You can list all tag by running `git tag -l`.

Make sure you are using a stable tag for the config you want to provision. For example, if you are provisioning ocp-workshop, use a tag like `ocp-workshop-prod-1.8`. This is done by simply running:

----
git checkout ocp-workshop-prod-1.8
----

=== EC2 instability
It has been seen that, on occasion, EC2 is generally unstable. This manifests in
various ways:

* The autoscaling group for the nodes takes an extremely long time to deploy, or
  will never complete deploying

* Individual EC2 instances may have terrible performance, which can result in
  nodes that seem to be "hung" despite being reachable via SSH.

There is not much that can be done in this circumstance besides starting over
(in a different region).

=== Re-Running
While Ansible is idempotent and supports being re-run, there are some known
issues with doing so. Specifically:

* You should skip the tag `nfs_tasks` with the `--skip-tags` option if you
  re-run the playbook **after** the NFS server has been provisioned and
  configured. The playbook is not safe for re-run and will fail.

== FAQ

* Is this a replacement for openshift-ansible playbook ? Why ?

No! First, this repository is a set of playbooks and roles, it is not only about OpenShift and AWS. A run is organized in several steps: pre_infra, infra, post_infra, pre_software, software, post_software. If  you choose to use a config that installs OpenShift, it will **actually use** the openshift-ansible playbook, also known as `byo/config.yml`, during the Software step.
