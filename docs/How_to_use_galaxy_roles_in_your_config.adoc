= Galaxy Roles

To use galaxy roles in your config, just do the following:

. Create `requirements.yml` file in the config directory, for example:
+
.`ansible/configs/{{env_type}}/requirements.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
---
- src: geerlingguy.docker
  name: docker
  version: '2.5.1'
----
. Use the role in the playbooks
+
.`ansible/configs/{{env_type}}/pre_software.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
- name: Some play
  hosts:
    - myhosts
  become: true
  gather_facts: False
  tasks:
    - name: install docker
      include_role:
        name: docker
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
Please use a pinned `version` in the `requirements.yml` file so the success of the deployment of your config does not depend on the stability of upstream galaxy roles.

[source,yaml]
.Make sure you use version pinning in `requirements.yml`
----
- src: geerlingguy.docker
  name: docker
  version: '2.5.1'

When you run Ansible Agnostic Deployer, it will automatically fetch and create the role in your config directory: `ansible/configs/{{env_type}}/roles/docker` for example.

== Development workflow

During development, the roles will be deployed and get in your way git-wise. To avoid that, there is a rule in the top-level link:../.gitignore[`.gitignore`] to ignore those dynamic roles:

.gitignore
----
ansible/configs/*/roles
----
The convention is:

> the "static" roles, those versioned in this repository, must live in link:../ansible/roles[`ansible/roles`] and the "dynamic" roles in your config directory `ansible/configs/{{env_type}}/roles`.

NOTE: Dynamic roles are not pushed in git, only the `requirements.yml` file is versioned.


== Multiple requirement files

Sometimes, for the same config, we need several `requirements.yml`. For example, one for PROD, one for DEV, etc.

You can create as many files as you want. When calling the playbook just override the `requirements_path` variable:

[source, bash]
----
ansible-playbook main.yml -e requirements_path=ansible/configs/{{env_type}}/requirements-prod.yml [...]
----
