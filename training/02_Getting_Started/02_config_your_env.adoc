= How to set up your laptop to develop AgnosticD workloads [[configs-laptop]]

In this document is aimed to be a reference on how to setup your laptop (both Linux and Mac OS) for Ansible Agnostic Deployer development with OpenStack, AWS and Azure.

Whilst this document primarily at Red Hatters, and partners, who can self provision an OpenStack (OSP) Sandbox via Red Hat’s link:https://rhpds.redhat.com[RHPDS] it may also be useful to others working both with OpenStack and Ansible Agnostic Deployer aka AgnosticD.

For the purpose of this exercise we’ll use the AgnosticD config link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/tree/development/ansible/configs/a-base-config[a-base-config] which is simple to deploy, and extensible for anyone looking to deploy some instances on OpenStack.

I’ll assume you have either self provisioned, or been provided with, an OpenStack Sandbox instance and have the necessary ssh login details etc. 

In order to request an OpenStack Sandbox instance, please go to link:labs.opentlc.com[labs.opentlc.com] and follow these steps:
. Log in to link:https://labs.opentlc.com[https://labs.opentlc.com] using your opentlc user.
. Go to *Services* -> *Catalogs* -> *Novello testing* -> *DEV OSP Sandbox*.
. Click *Order* -> *Submit*

NOTE: You will receive three emails indicating the status of the environment and instructions for accessing the environment.
In the third email you receive all information you need to login to the client machine that would have the rest of required information.

NOTE: You can use the VM as your ansible host or copy the files over to your laptop and work locally.

== Configure your environment for running OpenStack Ansible

In this document, I will use an OSP Sandbox instance as working machine, however, you can configure your own machine for this purpose. If you prefer to do so, please follow the instructions for link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/blob/development/training/02_Getting_Started/config_your_linux.adoc[Linux] or link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/blob/development/training/02_Getting_Started/configure_your_mac.adoc[Mac OS X machines].

=== Deployment Stages

Deployment can be divided logically into 6 short stages. In the course of this blog we’ll work our way through each stage:

1. Validating the OSP Sandbox instance can communicate with OpenStack
2. Validating the Ansible AgnosticD deployer
3. Creating a python virtualenv for working with OpenStack
4. Preparing your secrets, and credentials, for OpenStack
5. Preparing your a-base-config vars
6. Deploying your a-base-config config

==== Validating the OSP (OpenStack Platform) Sandbox instance can communicate with OpenStack

Before going further lets just validate your OSP ClientVM (be it your laptop or the bastion machine) can actually talk to an OpenStack Cluster. We’ll re-visit in section 3 how that authenticated for those of you not too familiar with OpenStack.

Credentials have been provided to you via email if you have requested access via link:https://labs.opentlc.com[https://labs.opentlc.com].

. Create the `~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml` file on your laptop using the information provided in the final email.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/openstack
$ vim ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml
----

. Review your `~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml`:
+
[source,bash]
----
cat ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml
clouds:
  35eb-project:
    auth:
      auth_url: "http://169.47.17.15:5000/v3"
      username: "35eb-user"
      project_name: "35eb-project"
      project_id: "1a79cf800ff94754bb495e2c1fd9d433"
      user_domain_name: "Default"
      password: "YOUR_TEMP_PASSWORD"
    region_name: "regionOne"
    interface: "public"
    identity_api_version: 3
----

. Check that your credentials are working.
In order to do so, first log into your bastion, using the credentials provided to you via email:
+
[source,bash]
----
sassenach:~ Cibeles$ ssh YOUR-OPENTLC-USER@bastion.GUID.red.osp.opentlc.com
YOUR-OPENTLC-USER@bastion.GUID.red.osp.opentlc.com's password: YOUR_EMAIL_PROVIDED_PASSWORD
----
+
[source,bash]
----
$ openstack --os-cloud=GUID-project server list

+--------------------------------------+-----------+--------+------------------------------------------------+-------+---------+
----

. Try to login to OpenStack UI: link:http://horizon.red.osp.opentlc.com/dashboard/auth/login/[]. You must use the credentials from `.config/openstack/clouds.yaml` to login to the UI.



NOTE: on Fedora `dnf install python3-openstacksdk python3-openstackclient python-openstackclient-doc python-openstackclient-lang python3-heatclient python-heatclient-doc python3-dns` will do the job (you may choose to skip doc and lang packages).



=== Getting your OpenStack Credentials



=== Setting up AgnosticD and your development environment

. Clone the AgnosticD repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd
----

. Create your `secret.yml` file *oustide the repository*, and edit it using the correct credentials based on your `clouds.yml` file:

+
[source,bash]
----
cat << EOF >> ~/secret.yml
# Authenication for OpenStack in order to create the things
# RED
osp_auth_username: CHANGEME
osp_auth_password: CHANGEME
osp_project_name: CHANGEME
osp_project_id: CHANGEME


osp_auth_url: http://169.47.188.15:5000/v3
osp_auth_project_domain: default
osp_auth_user_domain: default

# DNS

osp_cluster_dns_server: ddns01.opentlc.com
osp_cluster_dns_zone: students.osp.opentlc.com
ddns_key_name: PROVIDED_BY_ADMIN          # default value is set to "hmac-dm5"
ddns_key_secret: PROVIDED_BY_ADMIN

# Repo

own_repo_path: PROVIDED_BY_ADMIN

# Do not create PROJECT, we already have one and want to use it

osp_project_create: false

EOF
----

NOTE: You can find a secret.yml file provided to you on the home directory of your user at your bastion machine, use this to populate the file as previously stated.

[source,bash]
----
[YOUR_USER@bastion ~]$ ls
agnosticd  secrets.yaml
----

NOTE: It is required that OpenStack SDK is installed on your working machine. For further information, please refer to its link:https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/latest/user/[web page]

. *First checkpoint*, make sure this secret file is correct by running the test-empty-config.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd agnosticd/ansible

ansible-playbook main.yml \
  -e @configs/test-empty-config/sample_vars_osp.yml \
  -e @~/secret.yml
----

. Copy the `sample_vars.yml` file and call it `my_vars.yml`
+
[source,bash]
----
cp configs/just-a-bunch-of-nodes/sample_vars_osp.yml \
  configs/just-a-bunch-of-nodes/my_vars.yml
----

. Edit the `my_vars.yml` and change the `guid` value to something short and unique.
+
WARNING: Do not pick the same GUID as the one you got for access to the OSP cluster.

. *Second checkpoint*, Run the ansible-playbook command to deploy just-a-bunch-of-nodes
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook main.yml \
  -e @configs/just-a-bunch-of-nodes/my_vars.yml \
  -e @~/secret.yml
----
+
NOTE: If you are having python2 Vs. Python3 issues, Add `/usr/bin/python3.6` before the ansible-playbook command. For example: `/usr/bin/python3.6 ansible-playbook ansible/main.yml -e @configs/just-a-bunch-of-nodes/my_vars.yml -e@~/secret.yml`


. Check that the VM was installed and ssh into the box using the created key. In order to do so, first log into your bastion, using the credentials provided to you via email:
+
[source,bash]
----
sassenach:~ Cibeles$ ssh YOUR-OPENTLC-USER@bastion.GUID.red.osp.opentlc.com
YOUR-OPENTLC-USER@bastion.GUID.red.osp.opentlc.com's password: YOUR_EMAIL_PROVIDED_PASSWORD
----

+
[source,bash]
----

You can see there are some machines there and their IP addresses. Now you can log into your bastion machine from the outside world (your laptop) or from the bastion machine you were given credentials for in the email.

Let's log in from the outside world (your laptop) using your ${GUID}_infra_ssh_key.pem key file. Please note that the key file should be created in the machine you launched the playbook from.

. Now, if you want to log into any of your nodes, you just simply need to copy the identity file into the newly deployed bastion machine and ssh from it (as nodes do not have an external IP).
+
[source,bash]
----
sassenach:~ Cibeles$  scp -i /tmp/output_dir/testamaya_infra_ssh_key.pem /tmp/output_dir/testamaya_infra_ssh_key.pem cloud-user@169.47.188.156:.

Last login: Tue Jun  2 12:16:17 2020 from bastion.example.com
----

. You can now adapt `my_vars.yml` to your needs. Create different kind of instances, more security groups, etc.

=== Clean up

. Destroy the deployment:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook destroy.yml \
  -e @configs/just-a-bunch-of-nodes/my_vars.yml \
  -e @~/secret.yml
----

=== What's next ?

- link:../ansible/configs/ocp-workloads[ocp-workloads]: deploy an OpenShift app on a shared cluster. See link:../ansible/configs/ocp-workloads/sample_vars[`sample_vars`] directory.
- link:../ansible/configs/ocp4-cluster[ocp4-cluster]: deploy an OpenShift cluster. You can applied your workloads on top of it using the `ocp_workloads` list. See link:../ansible/configs/ocp4-cluster/sample_vars_osp.yml[sample_vars_osp.yml].
