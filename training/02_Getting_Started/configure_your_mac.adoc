= How to set up your Mac OS X laptop to develop AgnosticD workloads [[configs-mac-laptop]]

In order to have a working Ansible configuration in your Mac OS X laptop, please make sure the file `/etc/ansible/hosts` doesn't exist or is empty, otherwise this default inventory file will cause problems later.

Please note that Mac OS X has not support and it's best efforts based on my own experiences configuring my machine, PRs to this doc are welcomed.

== Creating a Python virtualenv for working with OpenStack

Ansible is written in Python and requires certain dependencies to work with cloud platforms. In this case it uses a python package called `openstacksdk` and others depending on the config being deployed.

Particularly as we transition from Python 2 to Python 3 the optimal way to work is to use a python virtualenv to isolate your environment. We will be using Python3 given the EOL of Python 2.

NOTE: You will need to install Python 2 or 3 are installed on Mac OS X, in case you already have it installed, you can see the instance if you execute `python --version`

1. Install Python on your Mac
I will use brew for that, which I find the easiest way, but other forms can be used. If you haven't installed brew on your Mac, you can follow these link:https://docs.brew.sh/Installation[instructions].
+
[source, shell]
----
$ brew install python pyenv-virtualenv
----

2. Create a virtualenv, called openstack taking care to use python3.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ pyenv virtualenv openstack-ansible-3.8
----

NOTE: If for any reason you want to use Python 2, simply do `$ pyenv virtualenv openstack-ansible-2.9`

3. Activate the virtualenv, (you will need to do this every-time you login).
$ source /Users/[USER]/.pyenv/versions/openstack-ansible-3.8/bin/activate

NOTE: Your prompt will now change to indicate the virtualenv has been activated. e.g. (openstack-ansible-3.8) [amaya@sassenach ]$

4. Upgrade pip, the python package manager, to the latest.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ pip install -upgrade pip
----

NOTE: if you find the error " the error: error: pyenv: pip: command not found]", it could because you need pip3, in that case please do:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ alias pip=pip3
$ pip install --upgrade pip
----

5. Install the 4 python packages you will need for your config: ansible, openstacksdk, selinux and dnspython. Each will pull in any necessary secondary dependencies.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ pip3 install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/development/ansible/configs/ocp4-disconnected-osp-lab/files/macos_requirements.txt
----

Install python modules needed by Ansible:
sudo pip install openstacksdk

Install OpenStack CLIs:
sudo pip install python-openstackclient python-heatclient

5. Validate your new virtualenv can communicate, via ansible, with OpenStack.
$ ansible localhost -m os_auth

Expect a successful outcome listing of JSON services and API endpoints with no error message ending similar to this, but with different IP addresses etc:
+
[source, shell]

            }
        ]
    },
    "changed": false
}

NOTE: Shall you encounter issues with your Mac OS X machine setup, please note this is best efforts and comes with no supply. However, we've created another doc, where you can find link:[common issues on Mac].

== Preparing your secrets and credentials for OpenStack
There are a number of ways to find, and authenticate to, OpenStack APIs. So far both the openstack command you used in Stage 1 and the Ansible ad-hoc command you just executed using the os_auth module found the necessary meta data via a clouds.yaml file. In this particular case here: ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml.

Create your clouds.yaml file with the content which has also have been emailed to you. Again your values may differ:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ cat ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml
clouds:
  9956-project:
    auth:
      auth_url: http://169.47.188.15:5000/v3
      username: a890-user
      project_name: a890-project
      project_id: ca3ef1650c6940058d1dd96236fc8619
      user_domain_name: Default
      password: QAEbTYD5eZp6
    region_name: regionOne
    interface: public
    identity_api_version: 3
----

Whilst Ansible itself can use `clouds.yaml` via the `openstacksdk` package you pip installed earlier AgnosticD actually uses a different way of authenticating to OpenStack via vars expressed in YAML. Fortunately your environment has been, largely, pre-configured via a file located at `~/.secrets.yml`

Now you need to create your secrets file, in this case, the content has not been mailed to you, but copied into your home directory on the bastion host. You can create this file in the directory that you like best, I personally use a directory where I store different config files, you will be calling it with the absolute path.

# Do not create PROJECT, we already have one and want to use it
osp_project_create: false
EOF
----

NOTE: If you are using a yum server via own_repo_path or have other sensitive variables for your deployment it makes sense to add them to your new `~/secrets.yml` file. If you are doing a workshop your instructor or facilitator can often supply these.
