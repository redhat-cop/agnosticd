== AgnosticD Foundations

== Introduction: 
Developer Story/Path
Goal: Introduce learner to AgnosticD basics. Students will be able to explain what AgnosticD is, what the currently supported cloud providers are, how the repository is structured and differences between configs and workloads are

=== Agenda: 
. What is AgnosticD
. Introduction Story and Ramifications
. What is a Cloud Provider
. What is a config, what is an infra-role, what is a ocp-workload role.
. How we use this in RHPDS
    .. Use cases for a configuration, show prod example (env_type variable)
    .. Use cases for a workload, show prod example
. Deployment Types in PROD for RHPDS Developers
. AgnosticV (iteration 2), what it is, how to set it up

== Competencies Covered:

== Describe the role of AgnosticD

== Describe the function of a config

Describe the function of a cloud provider
List the primary phases of an end to end config deployment (6 step process)
Highlight 3 use cases for deploying a config

Identify the default var file for a config

Explain the role of default_vars.yml

== How to get Started (Amaya)
Goal: Configure Workstation (OSP Sandbox) for AgnosticD use, execute a config from sandbox.
