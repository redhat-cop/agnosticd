== Meet Malcolm

Malcolm is a relatively new RedHatter with some development experience in a prior company.
He was just selected to help deliver a workshop oriented to the financial space in an official event.
Malcolm is extremely excited about the opportunity of showing the company's latest products for this important vertical, but in spite of being relatively familiar with containers, kubernetes, and some OpenShift, he faces the following challenges:

* Malcolm doesn't know much Ansible,
* He has a very comfortable IDE setup in his laptop and he would like to develop and test there, pushing to external repositories only when ready.
* He is under the pressure of the event deadline, so he need to develop in an agile way. The PM was very clear that she would cut anybody who wasn't ready out of the event.
