== Meet Inara

Inara is member of the infrastructure team in a partner company.
She has recently been introduced to the world of Ansible and took an Instructor-Led Training where the instructor showed the class how his team works every day using AgnosticD to deploy thousands of environments.
She immediately saw value in bringing this new tools to her team, given that they are suffering the pains brought by:

* Inconsistencies between dev/test/prod environments,
* Lack of the agility and speed necessary for the company's Dev team to be able to innovate with "momentum",
* Little to no environment documentation to understand where infra components live and how they are setup,
* Lack of knowledge of new team members on how to execute some installations and fixes.

Inara's objective during this training is to build a small, simple demo, so that she can show the team how fast and easy it is to setup AgnosticD and begin deploying with it, as well as modifying existing infrastructure.
