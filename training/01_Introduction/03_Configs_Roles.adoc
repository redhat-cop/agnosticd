== Configs

A config is simply a lab, workshop, or other deployment that has been defined and encapsulated in a series of playbooks, variable files, and templates in a config directory. 
This allows Ansible Agnostic Deployer to deploy it simply and repeatedly on one or more Cloud Platforms.

More Specifically, configs build infrastructure in a cloud provider. 
Meaning that we will expect a set of resources to result from the execution of the config. 
Usually, these resources are defined in a jinja template, normally located in a /files or /templates directory in the config's hosting directory.
