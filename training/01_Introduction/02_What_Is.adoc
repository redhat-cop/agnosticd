= What is AgnosticD?

*AgnosticD*, also known in the past as...

- Ansible Agnostic Deployer,
- or AAD,

is a fully automated 2 Phase deployer for building and deploying everything from basic infrastructure 
to fully configured running application environments running on either public cloud providers 
or OpenShift clusters.

IMPORTANT: *AgnosticD* is [.underline]#*not exclusively*# an OpenShift Deployer. Even though it can deploy OpenShift and *to* OpenShift, it
 is a deployer that just happens to be used to deploy a lot of OpenShift and OpenShift workload roles in our productive environments, it 
can do many other things that you will learn thoughout these training.
