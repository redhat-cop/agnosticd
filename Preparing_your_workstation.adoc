= Preparing your Workstation to use the Ansible Playbooks

== Prerequisites
In order to use these playbooks, you will need to set a few things up.

== Software Requirements on workstation

* Some deployments would require a Red Hat Customer Portal account that has
 appropriate subscriptions. This is not required for the playbook themselves.
+
NOTE: Red Hat employee subscriptions can be used


=== Software required for deployment

* [Python](https://www.python.org) version 2.7.x (3.x untested and may not work)
* [Python Boto](http://docs.pythonboto.org) version 2.41 or greater
* [Git](http://github.com) any version would do.
* [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) version 2.1.2 or greater
* [awscli bundle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip) tested with version 1.11.32
Python and the Python dependencies may be installed via your OS' package manager
(eg: python2-boto on Fedora/CentOS/RHEL) or via
[pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip). [Python
virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) can also work.

.Example script to install required software
[source,bash]
----

# Install basic packages
yum install -y  wget python python-pip unzip tmux git

# Install boto libraries for AWS access
pip install boto botocore boto3

#Install pywinrm if you plan to deploy windows VMs
pip install pywinrm

# Enable epel repositories for Ansible
cd /tmp
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
sudo yum -y install `ls *epel*.rpm`

# Install ansible and checked install version (required 2.2.0.0)
yum install -y ansible
ansible --version


## Install aws cli
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
unzip awscli-bundle.zip
sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /bin/aws
aws --version

== Configuring your workstation

=== Configure the EC2 Credentials

* You will need to place your EC2 credentials in the ~/.aws/credentials file:
[source, shell]
----
mkdir ~/.aws
cat << EOF >>  ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAJAAYOURACCESSKEY
aws_secret_access_key = rT54UYOURSECRETACCESSKEY

EOF
----

* Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent (optional)
If your operating system has an SSH agent and you are not using your default
configured SSH key, you will need to add the private key you use with your EC2
instances to your SSH agent:
+
----
ssh-add <path to key file>
----

NOTE: If you use an SSH config that specifies what keys to use for what
hosts this step may not be necessary.


=== AWS Permissions and Policies

AWS credentials for the account above must be used with the AWS command line
 tool (detailed below)

* An AWS IAM account with the following permissions:
- Policies can be defined for Users, Groups or Roles
- Navigate to: AWS Dashboard -> Identity & Access Management -> Select Users or Groups or Roles -> Permissions -> Inline Policies -> Create Policy -> Custom Policy
- Policy Name: openshift (your preference)
- Policy Document:
+
[source,json]

                "s3:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
----

NOTE: Finer-grained permissions are possible, and pull requests are welcome.


=== AWS existing resources

* A route53
 link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/CreatingHostedZone.html[public hosted zone]
  is required for the scripts to create the various DNS entries for the
    resources it creates. Two DNS entries will be created for workshops:
- `master.guid.domain.tld` - a DNS entry pointing to the master
- `*.cloudapps.guid.domain.tld` - a wildcard DNS entry pointing to the
      router/infrastructure node
* An EC2 SSH keypair should be created in advance and you should save the key
    file to your system.
+
[source,bash]
----
REGION=us-west-1
KEYNAME=ocpworkshop
openssl genrsa -out ~/.ssh/${KEYNAME}.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/${KEYNAME}.pem -pubout > ~/.ssh/${KEYNAME}.pub
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/${KEYNAME}.pub
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/${KEYNAME}.pem
touch ~/.ssh/config
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
aws ec2 import-key-pair --key-name ${KEYNAME} --region=$REGION --output=text --public-key-material "`cat ~/.ssh/${KEYNAME}.pub | grep -v PUBLIC`"
----
+
CAUTION: Key pairs are created per region, you will need to specify a different keypair for each region or duplicate the keypair into every region.
+
----
REGIONS="ap-southeast-1 ap-southeast-2 OTHER_REGIONS..."
for REGION in `echo ${REGIONS}` ;
  do
    aws ec2 import-key-pair --key-name ${KEYNAME} --region=$REGION --output=text --public-key-material "`cat ~/.ssh/${KEYNAME}.pub | grep -v PUBLIC`"
  done
