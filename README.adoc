== Overview

Ansible Agnostic Deployer, AKA *AAD*, AKA *AgnosticD*, is a fully automated 2
 Phase deployer for building and deploying everything from basic infrastructure
  to fully configured running application environments running on either public
   Cloud Providers or OpenShift clusters.


*AgnosticD* is not an OpenShift Deployer, though it can and does that, it is
 however also a deployer that just happens to be used to deploy a lot of
  OpenShift and OpenShift workloads, amongst other things.

=== Make your first Deployment

Check out this link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfHYwXJhKB0[Video Introduction to deploying with Ansible AgnosticD]!

Get started and use agnosticd to deploy on OpenStack with  link:docs/First_OSP_Env_walkthrough.adoc[First OSP Environment Walkthrough].

There are many link:./ansible/configs[configs] you can choose from, here are three
 that you can start with and modify to fit your needs:

* link:./ansible/configs/just-a-bunch-of-nodes/[Just a bunch of nodes] - Simple, multi-cloud.

* link:./ansible/configs/three-tier-app/README.adoc[Three Tier App] - Relatively
 simple environment, which deploys by default just a bunch of Linux hosts ready
  to be configured.

* link:./ansible/configs/ocp4-workshop/README.adoc[OCP4 Workshop] - If a fully
 installed OpenShift Cluster is what you are looking for then take a look here. There is link:ansible/configs/ocp4-cluster[one for OSP too].

* link:./ansible/roles/ocp-workload-rhte-mw-api-biz/readme.adoc[API as a Business demo Deployment] - Want to deploy a workload onto your existing OpenShift Cluster?
  or local instance running on your laptop?  3Scale is an example of one of
   around *30* OpenShift workloads ready to go.

=== How AgnosticD Deploys

* For OpenShift _Workloads_ *AgnosticD* executes an ansible *role* against an
 existing OpenShift cluster. Roles can be found link:./ansible/roles/[here] and
  begin `ocp-workload-*`.

* For _Configs_ each contain 5 deployment playbooks and supporting files executed
 in sequence and combined with a Cloud Provider to deploy basic infrastructure
  through to fully configured applications.

=== Getting Started

The accompanying documentation explains how to achieve all this, extend it and
 add both your own environments, hereafter called _configs_ and a lot lot more.
Well designed _configs_, can be easily abstracted to allow deployment to multiple
 different Public and Private Clouds including AWS, Azure, and others.

* link:./docs/[The Documentation Set] Start Here
* link:./ansible/[./ansible] The working ansible directory
** link:./ansible/main.yml[main.yml] The main entry point for `ansible-playbook`
* link:./ansible/roles[Roles directory] Home to the `ocp-workload-*` roles
* link:./ansible/configs[Configs directory] Home to the _Configs_
